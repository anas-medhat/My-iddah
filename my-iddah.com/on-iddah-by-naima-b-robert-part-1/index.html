            <h3><strong>Written by: Na&#8217;ima b. Robert</strong></h3>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>A part of me died four months and ten days ago.</strong><br />
But, alhamdulillah, it wasn&#8217;t hope. It wasn&#8217;t courage. And it definitely wasn&#8217;t faith and trust in my Lord&#8217;s perfect plan.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>The call that changed everything</h3>
<p>The call woke me before Fajr. My heart stopped as I tried to recognize the number on the screen. A blank. But when I answered the phone and heard the familiar voice of the doctor on the other side, I prepared myself for the worst.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
And the worst came: heart stopped beating, CPR attempted for 30 minutes, no hope.<br />
‘JazakAllahu khairan,’ I whispered hoarsely before cutting off the call. Then I immediately rose from the bed and fell into sujood of shukr. Alhamdulillah.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
It was the moment I had dreaded but also a moment I had been preparing myself for, ever since a sister, who had come to visit me at the hospital, had told me the story of a husband and wife whose daughter was desperately ill. Every time they came to the hospital, the doctors would tell them more reasons why she was not going to make it. And, at every visit, the father would turn to his wife and said, ‘Don’t forget.’<br />
This continued for several days, the doctors predicting the worst, and the husband reminding his wife not to forget, until the day they arrived and were given the news that would break any parent’s heart: <strong>their daughter had died.</strong><br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>Upon hearing the news, the husband turned to his wife and said to her, ‘Now,’ and they both fell into sujood of shukr.</strong><br />
&nbsp;<br />
The hospital staff were amazed, some of them even horrified. Surely this was a terribly sad event, one to be wept over, to be mourned, not to be celebrated with sujood?<br />
They asked the couple why, why had they done this?<br />
&nbsp;<br />
And the couple told the staff at that hospital how they had taken the decision to give thanks for their daughter’s life, for the joy she had brought them, for the love they had shared with her. Allah SWT had allowed them to love and care for her for all those years: <strong>should they not give thanks for this?</strong><br />
&nbsp;<br />
And, when I heard this story, I decided that that was what I was going to do, if it ever came to that.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Because, you see, <strong>I had no right to bemoan losing my husband, after being gifted with more happiness in 16 years than many taste in a several lifetimes.</strong> Alhamdulillah, Allah SWT guided us both to Islam and, a few short years later, to each other. My husband’s understanding and patient attitude brought out the best in me, in deen and dunyah. His way was not to command or force, but rather guide and, even, let me make my own mistakes and learn from them. As with those he worked with, his aim was always to support me in fulfilling my potential, because it was that quality that had drawn him to me in the first place (his words, not mine!). Quite simply, we understood each other, we supported each other, we were best friends and allies, as well as husband and wife. <strong>It is no exaggeration to say that, without him, I would not be the woman I am today.</strong> It was for this reason that I dedicated From My Sisters’ Lips to him, all those years ago: ‘For the wind beneath my wings’. I always prayed that any good I had done would be counted in the scale of his good deeds.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
As it was, Allah SWT took him after a bout of illness, after completing the Hajj twice (the last time, with me) and having recently taken all his children for ‘Umrah. He died a Muslim, on tawheed, in the land of the Muslims, well-loved by his family, friends and colleagues. Alhamdulillah, some things are indeed a comfort.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<h3>A deep and terrible loss</h3>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
In the days that followed his passing, I was on autopilot. There is no time for breaking down when you are a foreign national, trying to complete paperwork for a burial, on the day the British Embassy is closed for a UK holiday. I went through the motions: I Whatsapp&#8217;ed everyone to give them the news, I sat on the phone to try to get an appointment to allow his body to be buried in Egypt, as he would have wanted; I stood in crowded offices while my papers were shuffled back and forth, collecting stamps and signatures along the way.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
By the time we had finally got permission to bury him, we were late: the Dhuhr prayer was in less than an hour. My phone was dead. I knew that I wouldn’t be able to let people know about the Janazah in time. But, by that time, I was past caring.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
I observed the Janazah salah from the steps of the masjid and I said my last salaam to him in the courtyard before they took him on the long drive to the graveyard.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Surrounded by my children, my family, my in-laws, sisters, brothers, colleagues and well-wishers on every side, I felt like I was watching a scene in a movie. I played my part well: I was the gracious widow, receiving condolences, comforting others, maintaining my composure, but, in truth, my heart was aching. And yet, through it all, my faith in Allah SWT was undaunted, alhamdulillah.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
I wrote at the time: <em>I feel so incredibly blessed. Even in the midst of the trial, as the tears fall, I am surrounded by His Mercy. The du&#8217;as, the support, the love, the sense of strength and serenity, are all signs of His Mercy. Alhamdulillah, I accept. Alhamdulillah, I am at peace. Alhamdulillah, alhamdulillah, alhamdulillah is the balm for my aching heart.</em><br />
&nbsp;<br />
The next challenge, after burying him, would be mourning him, observing the ‘iddah&#8230;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
