				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><b>When True Love Comes Twice</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Zainab Bint Younus </b><span style="font-weight: 400">looks to the inspirations of the past and marvels at the many ways the heart can fall in love. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Many people are raised to believe that you live once, you die once and you only have one true love. A culture of fairy tales and happily ever afters, romcoms and romance novels has raised generations of people to believe that out there in the world is just </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">one</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> person who was meant to be with you &#8211; just </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">one</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> person </span><span style="font-weight: 400">with whom you will fall in love so deeply that you will never truly love anyone else besides them.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Umm Salamah (RA) proved this theory false. She had not just one love of her life, but </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">two</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> true loves! Umm Salamah was married to Abdullah ibn &#8216;Abdul-Asad &#8211; also known as Abu Salamah, the father of her child. Together, they were amongst the first of those who accepted Islam and made the first emigration to Abyssinia. Although they were separated on their second hijrah to Madinah, their love was strong and endured to see them reunited until Abu Salamah died of a battle wound. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Whilst on his deathbed, Umm Salamah tearfully told her husband, &#8220;if the husband of a woman dies and he is of the people of Paradise and his wife dies after him without having remarried, Allah will bring them back together in Jannah. Let us pledge that neither of us will remarry!&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Abu Salamah asked her, &#8220;Will you obey me in whatever I request of you?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Fervently, Umm Salamah replied, &#8220;Of course!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Abu Salamah gazed at her, his heart overflowing with love for her and told her, &#8220;If I die, swear to me that you will remarry!&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While Umm Salamah looked on in shock, he supplicated to Allah: &#8220;O Allah! Provide for Umm Salamah a man who is better than me!&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Umm Salamah spent her &#8216;iddah grieving for her deceased husband, her heart breaking every time she thought of his gentleness, his kindness, his courage and his patience. As she cradled her newborn daughter, she wept at the thought that Abu Salamah would never see his daughter and that there might be no man who would be willing to raise another man&#8217;s children as his own. She thought back often on his words and wondered, in anguish, &#8220;Who could be better than Abu Salamah?&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her question was answered almost immediately: when her &#8216;iddah ended at the birth of her daughter, Zaynab, Rasool Allah (SAW) asked for her hand in marriage. In disbelief, Umm Salamah sent him a response: &#8220;I am an older woman, I am a jealous woman and I have children from my previous husband.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With his characteristic tenderness, Rasool Allah (SAW) answered her fears: &#8220;I am older than you, Allah will remove jealousy from your heart and I will raise your children amongst my own.&#8221; </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The hesitation in Umm Salamah&#8217;s heart and the remnants of her grief for Abu Salamah faded away, replaced with a sense of calmness and peace. Abu Salamah&#8217;s du&#8217;a had been answered and, once again, Umm Salamah experienced the wonder and beauty of true love&#8230; for the second time.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There are many men and women who fall in love and are devastated at its loss, whether that loss occurs through death, divorce or simply tests and trials in life that one never anticipated. The grief that one experiences can feel overwhelming and unbearable and often one wonders if they will ever be able to experience such love again. Yet, though our own concept and understanding of love is limited, Allah, al-Wadud, is not. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Messenger of Allah (SAW) said: </span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">“Verily, the hearts of the children of Adam, all of them, are between the two fingers of the Most Merciful as one heart; He directs them wherever he wills.” </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">(Sahih Muslim 2654)</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The One who placed love in our hearts for one person is easily able to heal our broken hearts and grant us the deep joy and comfort of another love in our lives – someone whom we will love not as a replacement for the person we have lost before, but as someone who will have captured our hearts in their own unique way. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">On the other hand, there is the unique situation of polygamy. It is a difficult thing for many women to understand and accept and it’s true that polygamy amongst Muslims has garnered a bad reputation with a lot of negative baggage. Even so, it is something that should be recognised – although there are many Muslim men who have done polygamy badly, there are those who have done it well and with justice. Allah (SWT) has also blessed these men with true love, not once, but twice or even several more times. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Abu Bakr (RA) is well known for being married to two great women: Umm Rumaan, the mother of A’ishah (RA) and Asmaa’ bint ‘Umays. Although he divorced his first wife, Qutaylah, who did not accept Islam, Abu Bakr cared for Umm Rumaan and Asmaa’ dearly. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When Umm Rumaan died, Rasool Allah (SAW) prayed Salat ul-Janazah over her body and lowered her into her grave saying, “Whoever wishes to see a woman from amongst the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">hoor </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">of Paradise, let him look upon Umm Rumaan!” As for Asmaa’ bint ‘Umays, Abu Bakr specifically asked that she be the one to wash his body when he died. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For men and women alike, Allah’s mercy for His creation is such that He enables our hearts to be capable of so many different types of love; He has given us the ability to love, to lose and to love again. Indeed, it is through this very blessing of His, the gift of being able to love repeatedly and in so many ways, that our hearts grow closer to Him in </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">taqwa</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> &#8211; a love born of hope and awe. Truly, who is more deserving of our love than Al-Wadud?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>{And of His signs is that He created for you from yourselves mates that you may find tranquillity in them and He placed between you love and mercy. Indeed in that are signs for a people who give thought.}</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> (</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Ar-Room:21)</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Although commonly found in Muslim cultures, the following three rules are NOT authentic rules for the &#8216;iddah.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Having stated the requirements of <i>`iddah</i>, it is important to point out that there are a number of misgivings or misunderstandings among ordinary people concerning the dos and don’ts during <i>`iddah</i>, most of them, however, have no basis in the authentic teachings of Islam: Among them are the following:<br />
<b>1.</b> A widow in <i>`iddah</i> must never talk to any men. This is not correct; she is allowed to talk to men, regardless of whether they are her close relatives or not, so long as they observe the proper etiquettes and manners.</p>
<p><b>2.</b> She must confine herself to the sanctum of her home. This is also absolutely incorrect, as we have already stated that widows observing <i>`iddah</i> during the time of the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) were in the habit of going out to chat with their neighbors and he approved it.</p>
<p><b>3.</b> She is not allowed to put any oil in her hair. This is also incorrect, as she is allowed to use ordinary oils. She is only required to avoid scented oils, sprays, perfumes, and fragrances.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>From IslamQA.info</p>
<p>It is narrated in the hadeeth that a recently widowed woman is not allowed to do five things, and that she is required to do five things.</p>
<div class="list-group-item">
<div class="list-group-item-text ftwa-single-answer font-nrmal">
<p>1 – She should stay in her house where she was living when her husband died; this is the place where she should stay until the end of her ‘iddah, which lasts for four months and ten days, unless she is pregnant, in which case her ‘iddah ends when she gives birth, as Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):</p>
<p><i>“And for those who are pregnant (whether they are divorced or their husbands are dead), their ‘Iddah (prescribed period) is until they lay down their burden”</i></p>
<p><i>[al-Talaaq 65:4]</i></p>
<p>She should not leave the house except in case of need or necessity, such as going to the hospital if she is sick or to buy things she needs from the marketplace such as food etc., if she does not have someone with her who can do that. If the house is destroyed, then she should move elsewhere, or if she does not have anyone to keep her company and she fears for her safety, then it is OK for her to leave if there is a need to do so.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2 – She should not wear beautiful clothes, yellow, red, etc. Rather she should wear clothes that are not beautiful, whether they are black or green, etc. What matters is that the clothes should not be beautiful, as this is the command of the Prophet SAWS (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3 – She should avoid wearing jewellery of gold, silver, diamonds, pearls and the like, whether that is necklaces, bracelets or rings, etc., until her ‘iddah is over.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4 – She should avoid wearing perfume; she should avoid perfuming herself with bukhoor (incense) or any other kind of perfume, except when she purifies herself following her period, in which case she may perfume herself with a little bukhoor.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>5 – She should avoid kohl; she may not apply kohl or any similar kind of cosmetic that is used on the face, the kind of cosmetic that may attract people to her. But with regard to regular beautification by using soap and water, that is OK.  But the kohl which is used to make the eyes look beautiful and other kinds of cosmetics which some women use on their faces. This should not be done.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These are the five things which must be taken care of in the case of a woman whose husband dies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But with regard to what some of the common people think and have fabricated, that a recently-widowed woman should not speak to anyone or speak on the telephone, or that she should take a bath no more than once a week, or that she should not walk barefoot in the house, or go outside in the moonlight, and other similar myths, there is no basis for these things. She may walk in her house barefoot or wearing shoes; she may do what she needs to in her house, cooking food for herself and her guests; she may walk in the moonlight in the courtyard and garden of her house; she may take a bath whenever she wants; she may speak to whomever she wants in a manner that is not suspicious; she may shake hands with other women and with her mahrams, but not with non-mahrams; she may take off her khimaar (head cover) if there are no non-mahrams present. But she should not use henna or saffron or perfume, either on her clothes or in coffee, because saffron is a kind of perfume. No one should propose marriage to her, but it is OK to hint, but clearly proposing marriage is not allowed. And Allaah is the Source of help.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[About two months ago I met a good friend of mine and we were walking by the [&#8230;]]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400">About two months ago I met a good friend of mine and we were walking by the lake with Ruqaya. As we were leaving each other’s company, I told her, “if I had the choice to change what happened to </span><a href="https://www.facebook.com/amr.kassem.9047"><span style="font-weight: 400">Amr</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, I wouldn’t.” She told me that she was amazed at that statement and my “strength.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">On the drive home and ever since that day, I reproached my soul many times for what I thought was a lie. I wished that I had not said what I had said. Truthfully, my heart was aching for my husband and best friend, and I would have done anything or given anything for him to return to me.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">As time passed and Allah (swt) blessed me with a bit more understanding, I started to see the merit of that statement I had initially regretted saying. If I had the choice, I wouldn’t change what happened to Amr…</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Not because every day isn’t a tremendous struggle, and not because it isn’t eating away at my heart whenever I see Ruqaya’s doe eyes staring at a picture of her Baba&#8230;but rather it is because wanting him back would mean that I trust my own judgment above Allah’s Wisdom and Judgment. How could I say that it would be “better” if something different happened besides what Allah (swt) willed? I couldn’t say that. I couldn’t believe that.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">I don’t know why I said what I said then, but perhaps those words came directly from my heart so that Allah (swt) would guide me to reflect on them later. Even through the pain, I always believe that Allah has something better in mind for me: a better plan in this world and a better destination in the hereafter, inshaAllah. </span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">My Lord, I accept. I am satisfied with You as my Lord, with Islam as my faith and with Muhammad (peace be upon him) as the final Prophet.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Written by: Na&#8217;ima B. Robert</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="subheading-color">The literal meaning of Iddah is &#8220;to keep count&#8221;. In Islamic legal terminology, it is the period after a woman&#8217;s divorce or her husband’s demise, in which she has been instructed to refrain from getting married again. In this article, we&#8217;ll talk about the &#8216;iddah period for <strong>widows</strong>, specifically.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="subheading-color">The period of Iddah:</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
According to the directives of Allah SWT, the waiting period for widows is four months and ten days.</p>
<p class="ayah-color">“<em>And those of you who die and leave wives behind them, they (the wives) shall wait (as regards their marriage) for four months and ten days.</em>” (Surah Al-Baqarah, Verse 234)<br />
&nbsp;<br />
If the widow is pregnant, then the waiting period is till the birth of the child, irrespective of whether it is before the 4 month 10 days period or several months after it. <em>“And for those who are pregnant, their Iddah (prescribed period) is until they lay down their burden; ”</em> (Surah At-Talaq, Verse 4)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="subheading-color">What is mourning?</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
In a hadith the Prophet (SAW) is reported as saying: “It is not lawful for a woman who believes in Allah and the Last Day, that she should mourn a dead person for more than three days except in the case of her husband whom she should mourn for four months and ten days.” (Muttafiq ‘Alaih)</p>
<p class="subheading-color">Mourning is:</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<strong>1.To refrain from adornment.</strong><br />
A widow observing the waiting period, should not beautify herself in any way or wear ornaments. She should not wear attractive clothes or bright colors. All kinds of make-up including henna and kohl is forbidden; neither can she apply perfume or wear jewelery.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Wisdom: The wisdom of this instruction to adopt simplicity is two-fold: it is done to show respect and honour for the sanctity of the marriage bond and the time spent with her husband; also to avoid the possibility of receiving marriage proposals.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>2.To avoid going out.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
</strong>During the waiting period, the widow should not leave her house except if it is for some important reason (the necessity of which is left to her judgement based on her Taqwa- her love, respect and fear of Allah).<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p class="subheading-color">Livelihood Requirements:</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
During the waiting period, if there is no one else to do this for her, a widow is allowed to go out for absolutely unavoidable tasks, such as going to the doctor, taking the children to school, shopping for groceries etc Similarly, if she has no one to provide for her and no other means of income, and she needs to earn her livelihood, then it is permissible to take up employment, resume her job in order to ensure it’s continuity, or as is the case in villages, to work on the land and tend to the cattle. However the other conditions of Iddah must be observed i.e. simplicity and lack of adornment and returning home before nightfall. (Allah knows best)<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p class="subheading-color">Abroad or During Haj:</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
If she has permanent residence abroad or if she is widowed during an overseas visit, where the local laws do not allow her to stay on, then she should return to he own country. Similarly, if she is widowed during Haj, it is naturally not possible for her to stay there, and in these situations, the instruction to spend the Iddah period where her husband passed away does not apply. She can return to her own country to spend the waiting period in her own home.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
The Prophet (SAW) said:</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Written by: Asmaa Hussein</h3>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>Most women dream of growing old with their husbands – encountering their first grey hairs together, breathing a sigh of relief when their last child is finally married, and planning their retirement.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<span style="font-weight: 400">Every woman wants a partner she can lean on and build a harmonious life with. Regardless of age, no woman wishes to take on the title of “widow.”</span><br />
&nbsp;<br />
<span style="font-weight: 400">Allah (swt) says, “It is He who created you from dust, then from a sperm-drop, then from a clinging clot; then He brings you out as a child; then [He develops you] that you reach your [time of] maturity, then [further] that you become elders. And among you is he who is taken in death before [that], so that you reach a specified term; and perhaps you will use reason” (40:67).</span><br />
&nbsp;<br />
<span style="font-weight: 400">No one is guaranteed old age. The span of our lives is something Allah (swt) has already planned. He sometimes takes the people we love and rely on as a test of our faith – will we remain steadfast and patient, or will we turn away from His reminder of the brevity of this existence?</span><br />
&nbsp;<br />
<span style="font-weight: 400">When a woman loses her husband, whether to illness, accident, violence or natural causes, she is faced with the immense task of holding on to patience and raising her children – all while encountering one of the most difficult losses. The support of her family, friends and community is paramount to her emotional and physical well-being.</span><br />
&nbsp;<br />
<span style="font-weight: 400">Supporting a widow and her children is a noble task. The Prophet Muhammad (saw) said, “One who cares for widows and the poor is like those who fight in the way of Allah or those who spend their days fasting and their nights praying.”</span><br />
&nbsp;<br />
<span style="font-weight: 400">He also said, “Would you like that your heart becomes soft and that you acquire what you need? Be merciful with the orphan, pat his head and feed him from what you eat. This will soften your heart, and enable you to get what you need.”</span><br />
&nbsp;<br />
<span style="font-weight: 400">There are many ways you can support a widow and her children. Here are some of them:</span></p>
<ol>
	&nbsp;
<li><b> Remain steadfast in your friendship to her</b></li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<span style="font-weight: 400">If you are close to her, call her and visit her regularly. You can even make a schedule for your visits that work for both of you (e.g. every third Saturday). When someone is going through the loss of a spouse, having a friend consistently visit and check up on her can make all the difference to her spiritual and emotional health.</span><br />
&nbsp;<br />
<span style="font-weight: 400">Always bring wholesome, homemade food with you when you visit. Cooking is not at the top of her priority list now, and even she </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">has</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> to cook for herself or her children – she would probably rather not. If you’re bringing a meal, this will also take “hosting” pressure off of her so she can just enjoy your company without worrying about what to serve you.</span></p>
<ol start="2">
&nbsp;</p>
<li><b> Be patient with her</b></li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<span style="font-weight: 400">You want to support your friend and that is admirable. If she does not wish to have visitors at a particular time, respect her wishes for privacy – but still maintain regular contact.</span><br />
&nbsp;<br />
<span style="font-weight: 400">If you call, text or email her and she does not respond right away, don’t become upset or annoyed. She is encountering a set of emotional, financial and spiritual challenges that are very difficult. If after a day of dealing with those challenges, she doesn’t have the energy to respond to your messages, give her a break.</span><br />
&nbsp;<br />
<span style="font-weight: 400">(But don’t take that as an excuse to not maintain regular contact. You can still write to her and send her encouraging and supportive messages without always expecting a reply. She will appreciate your effort.)</span></p>
<ol start="3">
&nbsp;</p>
<li><b> Love her children</b></li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<span style="font-weight: 400">Losing the father of her children is one of the greatest sore points a widow will experience. Whereas she previously had someone to help her support, raise, discipline, and love her children, she is now faced with the task of doing all of that alone. The nagging feeling of being a single parent weighs heavily on her shoulders. While juggling her many responsibilities, she may fear that her children aren’t getting enough attention and have lost a significant role model in their lives.</span><br />
&nbsp;<br />
<span style="font-weight: 400">Love her children. Don’t just hand her an envelope with some cash in it or buy her children some toys and then ignore them (although toys are always appreciated by kids!). Come into her home and play with them, read to them, teach them something new. Take them on a trip to the zoo or to a park. Become their surrogate family member. They are now orphans, and every moment you spend supporting them is a moment in which Allah (swt) will reward you. As the Prophet Muhammad (saw) said in the previously mentioned hadith, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">you </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">are the one who will benefit from being kind to orphans.</span><br />
&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="4">
<li><b> Don’t pressure her into remarriage</b></li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<span style="font-weight: 400">Don’t pressure a widow into remarrying, especially during her mourning period. The period of four months and ten days is nobody’s but </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">hers</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">. She chooses how to mourn. She chooses what she wants to talk about, or what she doesn’t want to discuss at all. Respect her space in this time.</span><br />
&nbsp;<br />
<span style="font-weight: 400">The topic of remarriage is bound to be on her mind, and if she brings it up, discuss it with her gently. If she doesn’t, respect her privacy on the issue.</span><br />
&nbsp;<br />
<span style="font-weight: 400">If you still feel strongly that you are able and qualified to advise her on the issue of remarriage, tread carefully and employ wisdom and understanding.</span><br />
&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="5">
<li><b> Don’t unknowingly leave her out</b></li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<span style="font-weight: 400">Losing a beloved spouse leaves a widow feeling emotionally raw. Everything she hears and reads has the potential to cause those unhelpful and difficult feelings to resurface. While we should always be careful regarding what we say to people, be extra vigilant when you are interacting with her.</span><br />
&nbsp;<br />
<span style="font-weight: 400">For example, did you just invite a widow and single mother to an event with “</span><b>no children allowed</b><span style="font-weight: 400">” boldly listed on the invitation? To you it might not seem like an issue, but to someone who has lost her husband and doesn’t necessarily have access to any other regular or trusted babysitter, this could leave her feeling alienated. Make an effort to include her and her children in your activities, even if you’d rather have a child-free event.</span><br />
&nbsp;<br />
<span style="font-weight: 400">Take the time to contemplate her situation and include her in your events and gatherings.</span><br />
&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="6">
<li><b> Offer financial help – tactfully and respectfully</b></li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<span style="font-weight: 400">Losing a spouse may sometimes mean losing the family’s breadwinner. But offering a widow a pile of cold, hard cash might embarrass her or make her feel uneasy. We are commanded by Allah (swt) to care for widows and orphans in our community, but we are also encouraged to always give in a way that honours the recipient.</span><br />
&nbsp;<br />
<span style="font-weight: 400">Some people are very well meaning – they ask widows openly whether they need financial assistance. While that is admirable, more often than not, the widow will reply with a resounding “no,” even if she </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">is</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> need.</span><br />
&nbsp;<br />
<span style="font-weight: 400">It is imperative to provide help to widows and their children while still protecting their honour and dignity. So, be a good listener. Find out where she shops for her kids and get her a gift card. Is she having trouble with her old phone or computer but can’t afford a new one? Buy her one as a gift and say, “I noticed you were having trouble with your laptop, so me and a few friends chipped in to get you this new one!” Instead of being embarrassed, she will be happy that a) you noticed and listened, and b) you were caring enough to give her a </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">gift</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">, instead of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">charity</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">.</span><br />
&nbsp;<br />
<span style="font-weight: 400">May Allah (swt) grant relief and comfort to the widows and orphans of our communities, and may He abundantly reward those who seek to help and support them.</span><br />
&nbsp;<br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Written by: Leah D. Hanoosh</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"><strong>Sometimes love is not enough</strong>. Repeat that to yourself. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Some reading this may do so, wondering why I state the obvious. Others, especially those of us who are converts and/or have been brought up surrounded by the typically “Western” narrative of marriage, may repeat the words with a touch of hesitation. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Love is not enough. <em>Love is</em><em> not enough?  </em></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Don’t misunderstand: love brings light, harmony, joy, and adventure to a relationship. Love is a wonderful and important element in a marriage. <em>But it is not enough</em>. It is not the foundation upon which marriage must be based. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What, then, is that foundation? Once you answer that question for yourself, you will be equipped to begin preparing for a new, healthy marriage.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We crave love. Having survived divorce, completed your iddah, and now arrived at the point where you are hoping to remarry, it is normal that you should desire a warm and loving relationship. However, if I were allowed only one piece of advice to give to those preparing for a new marriage, it would be this: </span><strong>treat any match like a business transaction before you allow emotions to enter the equation.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Make a list. What personal qualities are you looking for? What are the prerequisites for any candidate before consideration? What essential elements must your relationship hold? Which points are non-negotiable? Where may you be open to compromise? Ask any potential match to create a similar list. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If this approach seems somewhat cold and methodical, that is a good thing. In the beginning, imagine you are interviewing candidates for a job, rather than searching for your life partner. Though this may be a difficult mindset to adopt, for some, it is ultimately for your own benefit. If you discover that a possible future husband is incompatible, or he holds some sort of belief or characteristic that is a deal breaker, it will be much easier to say no if you aren’t in love. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Once in love, we tend to make excuses, to hope for change in our partner, to convince ourselves that it will be okay – even if it won’t. It can be painful to break things off. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In every Disney love story, the movie ends with a wedding. But in Islam, <em>the wedding is the beginning. </em></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Everything we do before we marry must be in an attempt to create a foundation upon which we can live the rest of our lives. But how do we do that? What do we look for? Though I have advised thus far that love is not enough and that you should create lists, I have given few specifics. I have taken this approach because the journey to a new marriage is highly individual. What I looked for in a husband may be vastly different from anyone else. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We all hold different values and we all have different priorities. Some of us may hold religiosity to the highest standard of importance. Some may have an adamant desire for more children (or any children at all), while others are willing to compromise on that point. However, no matter your personal deal breakers, no matter your list of priorities, every marriage must have within its foundation the elements of <strong>respect</strong> and <strong>trust</strong>. It is <em>impossible</em> to have a healthy marriage without these things. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After you have made your lists and found someone compatible, work on establishing respect, work on building trust. A marriage where there is a lack of respect on one or both sides is a toxic one. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The above is more or less the model my husband and I followed as we were getting to know one another before we definitively decided that we wanted to marry. We exchanged emails, spent many hours on the phone, discussing our personal beliefs and priorities in detail. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We did not – do not – correspond identically, nor do any two people, I am sure. But we decided very early on to be methodical in our approach to marriage. It worked well for us. We connected first on a rational level, our personalities clicked, and a relationship of love grew from there, and continues to grow. I believe that as long as all parties are exercising honesty, it should work well for any couple. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It is vital to remember, however, that no matter how compatible you seem with your husband-to-be, there will be bumps in the road. <strong>No marriage, even those between the closest of friends and the greatest of soulmates, is without its difficulties.</strong> This is, perhaps, the second most important piece of advice, and one that my grandma gave me on more than one occasion: </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">marriage can be hard</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">. It can be especially difficult to bear that in mind as we search for our true love, our real happily ever after. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After divorce, we thirst even more for a relationship filled with the simplicity of comfort and love. But with the right partner, bumps in the road are steps towards that place of comfort. It is as Allah told us in the Quran: “Verily, after hardship comes ease.” </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In Surat ar-Rum, Allah said: </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">“And among His signs is this, that He created for you mates from among yourselves, that you may dwell in tranquility with them, that He has put love and mercy between you…”</span></i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Love may not be a good building block upon which to begin a marriage, but with a good foundation – trust and respect – and strong supporting pillars – compatibility of priorities, beliefs, and personality – love is something that will naturally bloom. </span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3><strong>Written by: Fatima Asmal</strong></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At the end of the day, we are all but human.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">I was always obsessed with the idea of marriage. </span><span style="font-weight: 400">Before my first marriage, I wanted to marry and I did. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For six years after that ended, I was even more obsessed with the idea of getting married.  So much so, that I married a man who had already proven himself to be extremely abusive during our engagement period. Verily with every difficulty comes ease, and from that miserable situation my son, Amr, my greatest blessing was born.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The obsession started to wane thereafter but didn&#8217;t completely leave me, and a few years after that I married yet again&#8230;</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Again, not the wisest of choices of a partner, and when I was asked to make a choice between that unstable marriage and my son, I chose Amr.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I never looked back thereafter. The desire for male companionship which had always prevailed within me died, and I focused all my energies on my son, parents, close friends, and my two careers &#8211; one in journalism and the other in running a charity I founded called &#8220;ILM-SA.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But like I said, we are all human.  And every now and then &#8211; ever so seldom- I do reflect about the way my life has turned out &#8211; living at my parents&#8217; home with them and my son.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once, a couple of years ago, I had to have my mum admitted into the hospital. This entailed taking her from our family doctor to her specialist and then sitting for hours in a waiting room trying to arrange for her medical aid and admission.  My son was a lot younger and anxious. I had to ask my best friend to babysit him. Rush home, pack my mummy&#8217;s bag, rush back. I had to somehow work him into the equation because he didn&#8217;t want to be away from me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then there was the time Amr was severely dehydrated. Again, a friend was asked to take me to a doctor.  Another friend was summoned to take us to the hospital.  She &#8211; may Allah Reward her &#8211; swiped her credit card at admission (yes his father reimbursed her later on but that was not an overnight process or one free of interrogation). I remained at his side at the hospital, talking him through procedures. Packing us clothes and essentials was the responsibility of my mum, may Allah bless her.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Recently, after a wedding, we were at my aunt&#8217;s house, when my mother starting throwing up and feeling extremely dizzy. By the time everyone had left, she was unable to stand up unassisted due to her blood pressure and sugar levels being abnormally high. At close to midnight or perhaps thereafter, I called my cousin who is our family doctor and she got out bed, accompanied by her son, to check on mum.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mum had to stay at my aunty&#8217;s house that night, and so there for the umpteenth time in my life you had me, a single woman (and not the best of drivers) driving along on not the safest routes to get home. There were rocks on some parts of the road, puddles and potholes elsewhere. And since I am but human, I wondered, <em>&#8220;How different would my life me if I was married to a decent human being?&#8221;</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My little man seated next to me brought me out of that thinking. He told me when to drive slowly and how to avoid dodgy parts of the road. At home, he locked the gates and turned off all the lights. He told me he loved me. He cuddled me till he fell into a deep sleep.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Few people in my close family have ever deemed it appropriate to introduce me to anyone. I was always labeled ‘lazy’ (because I&#8217;m not a chef) and ‘big mouth’ (because I speak my mind).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the wedding I mentioned earlier, a female family member suggested she introduce me to someone who was also attending. I declined because it is not the right time for Amr and I currently, but I was touched.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"><em>“What do these incidents have to do with anything?”</em> you may be asking.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, I feel that there are very few non-judgmental people in our community, people who recognize that it is possible for a woman not to be entirely responsible for her three failed marriages. People who recognize that a lack of love for the kitchen doesn&#8217;t equate to a lack of love in a woman&#8217;s heart. People who equate straight-forward-ness with sincerity and not having a big mouth. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As Amr grows older and these incidents like mum and him getting ill occur, I do concede that some day I may elect to marry again and perhaps when that day arrives Allah will send forth a non-judgmental individual, open-hearted enough to introduce me to a mature, open-hearted, generous man for whom marriage is much, much more than sexual gratification.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For now, I must say I would not have come this far in one piece without a close-friend who has really over-extended herself in our regard, without my mum, without my dad, without my Amr, without Allah, and without the Good Samaritan matchmakers who remind me that I am still human.</span></p>
