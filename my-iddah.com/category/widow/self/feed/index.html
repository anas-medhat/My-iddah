				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><b>When True Love Comes Twice</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Zainab Bint Younus </b><span style="font-weight: 400">looks to the inspirations of the past and marvels at the many ways the heart can fall in love. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Many people are raised to believe that you live once, you die once and you only have one true love. A culture of fairy tales and happily ever afters, romcoms and romance novels has raised generations of people to believe that out there in the world is just </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">one</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> person who was meant to be with you &#8211; just </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">one</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> person </span><span style="font-weight: 400">with whom you will fall in love so deeply that you will never truly love anyone else besides them.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Umm Salamah (RA) proved this theory false. She had not just one love of her life, but </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">two</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> true loves! Umm Salamah was married to Abdullah ibn &#8216;Abdul-Asad &#8211; also known as Abu Salamah, the father of her child. Together, they were amongst the first of those who accepted Islam and made the first emigration to Abyssinia. Although they were separated on their second hijrah to Madinah, their love was strong and endured to see them reunited until Abu Salamah died of a battle wound. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Whilst on his deathbed, Umm Salamah tearfully told her husband, &#8220;if the husband of a woman dies and he is of the people of Paradise and his wife dies after him without having remarried, Allah will bring them back together in Jannah. Let us pledge that neither of us will remarry!&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Abu Salamah asked her, &#8220;Will you obey me in whatever I request of you?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Fervently, Umm Salamah replied, &#8220;Of course!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Abu Salamah gazed at her, his heart overflowing with love for her and told her, &#8220;If I die, swear to me that you will remarry!&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While Umm Salamah looked on in shock, he supplicated to Allah: &#8220;O Allah! Provide for Umm Salamah a man who is better than me!&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Umm Salamah spent her &#8216;iddah grieving for her deceased husband, her heart breaking every time she thought of his gentleness, his kindness, his courage and his patience. As she cradled her newborn daughter, she wept at the thought that Abu Salamah would never see his daughter and that there might be no man who would be willing to raise another man&#8217;s children as his own. She thought back often on his words and wondered, in anguish, &#8220;Who could be better than Abu Salamah?&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her question was answered almost immediately: when her &#8216;iddah ended at the birth of her daughter, Zaynab, Rasool Allah (SAW) asked for her hand in marriage. In disbelief, Umm Salamah sent him a response: &#8220;I am an older woman, I am a jealous woman and I have children from my previous husband.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With his characteristic tenderness, Rasool Allah (SAW) answered her fears: &#8220;I am older than you, Allah will remove jealousy from your heart and I will raise your children amongst my own.&#8221; </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The hesitation in Umm Salamah&#8217;s heart and the remnants of her grief for Abu Salamah faded away, replaced with a sense of calmness and peace. Abu Salamah&#8217;s du&#8217;a had been answered and, once again, Umm Salamah experienced the wonder and beauty of true love&#8230; for the second time.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There are many men and women who fall in love and are devastated at its loss, whether that loss occurs through death, divorce or simply tests and trials in life that one never anticipated. The grief that one experiences can feel overwhelming and unbearable and often one wonders if they will ever be able to experience such love again. Yet, though our own concept and understanding of love is limited, Allah, al-Wadud, is not. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Messenger of Allah (SAW) said: </span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">“Verily, the hearts of the children of Adam, all of them, are between the two fingers of the Most Merciful as one heart; He directs them wherever he wills.” </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">(Sahih Muslim 2654)</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The One who placed love in our hearts for one person is easily able to heal our broken hearts and grant us the deep joy and comfort of another love in our lives – someone whom we will love not as a replacement for the person we have lost before, but as someone who will have captured our hearts in their own unique way. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">On the other hand, there is the unique situation of polygamy. It is a difficult thing for many women to understand and accept and it’s true that polygamy amongst Muslims has garnered a bad reputation with a lot of negative baggage. Even so, it is something that should be recognised – although there are many Muslim men who have done polygamy badly, there are those who have done it well and with justice. Allah (SWT) has also blessed these men with true love, not once, but twice or even several more times. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Abu Bakr (RA) is well known for being married to two great women: Umm Rumaan, the mother of A’ishah (RA) and Asmaa’ bint ‘Umays. Although he divorced his first wife, Qutaylah, who did not accept Islam, Abu Bakr cared for Umm Rumaan and Asmaa’ dearly. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When Umm Rumaan died, Rasool Allah (SAW) prayed Salat ul-Janazah over her body and lowered her into her grave saying, “Whoever wishes to see a woman from amongst the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">hoor </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">of Paradise, let him look upon Umm Rumaan!” As for Asmaa’ bint ‘Umays, Abu Bakr specifically asked that she be the one to wash his body when he died. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For men and women alike, Allah’s mercy for His creation is such that He enables our hearts to be capable of so many different types of love; He has given us the ability to love, to lose and to love again. Indeed, it is through this very blessing of His, the gift of being able to love repeatedly and in so many ways, that our hearts grow closer to Him in </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">taqwa</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> &#8211; a love born of hope and awe. Truly, who is more deserving of our love than Al-Wadud?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>{And of His signs is that He created for you from yourselves mates that you may find tranquillity in them and He placed between you love and mercy. Indeed in that are signs for a people who give thought.}</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> (</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Ar-Room:21)</span></p>

		<description><![CDATA[About two months ago I met a good friend of mine and we were walking by the [&#8230;]]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400">About two months ago I met a good friend of mine and we were walking by the lake with Ruqaya. As we were leaving each other’s company, I told her, “if I had the choice to change what happened to </span><a href="https://www.facebook.com/amr.kassem.9047"><span style="font-weight: 400">Amr</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, I wouldn’t.” She told me that she was amazed at that statement and my “strength.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">On the drive home and ever since that day, I reproached my soul many times for what I thought was a lie. I wished that I had not said what I had said. Truthfully, my heart was aching for my husband and best friend, and I would have done anything or given anything for him to return to me.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">As time passed and Allah (swt) blessed me with a bit more understanding, I started to see the merit of that statement I had initially regretted saying. If I had the choice, I wouldn’t change what happened to Amr…</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Not because every day isn’t a tremendous struggle, and not because it isn’t eating away at my heart whenever I see Ruqaya’s doe eyes staring at a picture of her Baba&#8230;but rather it is because wanting him back would mean that I trust my own judgment above Allah’s Wisdom and Judgment. How could I say that it would be “better” if something different happened besides what Allah (swt) willed? I couldn’t say that. I couldn’t believe that.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">I don’t know why I said what I said then, but perhaps those words came directly from my heart so that Allah (swt) would guide me to reflect on them later. Even through the pain, I always believe that Allah has something better in mind for me: a better plan in this world and a better destination in the hereafter, inshaAllah. </span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">My Lord, I accept. I am satisfied with You as my Lord, with Islam as my faith and with Muhammad (peace be upon him) as the final Prophet.</span></p>

		<description><![CDATA[Written by: Asmaa Hussein &#160; &#160; &#160; Most women dream of growing old with their husbands – [&#8230;]]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Written by: Asmaa Hussein</h3>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>Most women dream of growing old with their husbands – encountering their first grey hairs together, breathing a sigh of relief when their last child is finally married, and planning their retirement.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<span style="font-weight: 400">Every woman wants a partner she can lean on and build a harmonious life with. Regardless of age, no woman wishes to take on the title of “widow.”</span><br />
&nbsp;<br />
<span style="font-weight: 400">Allah (swt) says, “It is He who created you from dust, then from a sperm-drop, then from a clinging clot; then He brings you out as a child; then [He develops you] that you reach your [time of] maturity, then [further] that you become elders. And among you is he who is taken in death before [that], so that you reach a specified term; and perhaps you will use reason” (40:67).</span><br />
&nbsp;<br />
<span style="font-weight: 400">No one is guaranteed old age. The span of our lives is something Allah (swt) has already planned. He sometimes takes the people we love and rely on as a test of our faith – will we remain steadfast and patient, or will we turn away from His reminder of the brevity of this existence?</span><br />
&nbsp;<br />
<span style="font-weight: 400">When a woman loses her husband, whether to illness, accident, violence or natural causes, she is faced with the immense task of holding on to patience and raising her children – all while encountering one of the most difficult losses. The support of her family, friends and community is paramount to her emotional and physical well-being.</span><br />
&nbsp;<br />
<span style="font-weight: 400">Supporting a widow and her children is a noble task. The Prophet Muhammad (saw) said, “One who cares for widows and the poor is like those who fight in the way of Allah or those who spend their days fasting and their nights praying.”</span><br />
&nbsp;<br />
<span style="font-weight: 400">He also said, “Would you like that your heart becomes soft and that you acquire what you need? Be merciful with the orphan, pat his head and feed him from what you eat. This will soften your heart, and enable you to get what you need.”</span><br />
&nbsp;<br />
<span style="font-weight: 400">There are many ways you can support a widow and her children. Here are some of them:</span></p>
<ol>
	&nbsp;
<li><b> Remain steadfast in your friendship to her</b></li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<span style="font-weight: 400">If you are close to her, call her and visit her regularly. You can even make a schedule for your visits that work for both of you (e.g. every third Saturday). When someone is going through the loss of a spouse, having a friend consistently visit and check up on her can make all the difference to her spiritual and emotional health.</span><br />
&nbsp;<br />
<span style="font-weight: 400">Always bring wholesome, homemade food with you when you visit. Cooking is not at the top of her priority list now, and even she </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">has</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> to cook for herself or her children – she would probably rather not. If you’re bringing a meal, this will also take “hosting” pressure off of her so she can just enjoy your company without worrying about what to serve you.</span></p>
<ol start="2">
&nbsp;</p>
<li><b> Be patient with her</b></li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<span style="font-weight: 400">You want to support your friend and that is admirable. If she does not wish to have visitors at a particular time, respect her wishes for privacy – but still maintain regular contact.</span><br />
&nbsp;<br />
<span style="font-weight: 400">If you call, text or email her and she does not respond right away, don’t become upset or annoyed. She is encountering a set of emotional, financial and spiritual challenges that are very difficult. If after a day of dealing with those challenges, she doesn’t have the energy to respond to your messages, give her a break.</span><br />
&nbsp;<br />
<span style="font-weight: 400">(But don’t take that as an excuse to not maintain regular contact. You can still write to her and send her encouraging and supportive messages without always expecting a reply. She will appreciate your effort.)</span></p>
<ol start="3">
&nbsp;</p>
<li><b> Love her children</b></li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<span style="font-weight: 400">Losing the father of her children is one of the greatest sore points a widow will experience. Whereas she previously had someone to help her support, raise, discipline, and love her children, she is now faced with the task of doing all of that alone. The nagging feeling of being a single parent weighs heavily on her shoulders. While juggling her many responsibilities, she may fear that her children aren’t getting enough attention and have lost a significant role model in their lives.</span><br />
&nbsp;<br />
<span style="font-weight: 400">Love her children. Don’t just hand her an envelope with some cash in it or buy her children some toys and then ignore them (although toys are always appreciated by kids!). Come into her home and play with them, read to them, teach them something new. Take them on a trip to the zoo or to a park. Become their surrogate family member. They are now orphans, and every moment you spend supporting them is a moment in which Allah (swt) will reward you. As the Prophet Muhammad (saw) said in the previously mentioned hadith, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">you </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">are the one who will benefit from being kind to orphans.</span><br />
&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="4">
<li><b> Don’t pressure her into remarriage</b></li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<span style="font-weight: 400">Don’t pressure a widow into remarrying, especially during her mourning period. The period of four months and ten days is nobody’s but </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">hers</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">. She chooses how to mourn. She chooses what she wants to talk about, or what she doesn’t want to discuss at all. Respect her space in this time.</span><br />
&nbsp;<br />
<span style="font-weight: 400">The topic of remarriage is bound to be on her mind, and if she brings it up, discuss it with her gently. If she doesn’t, respect her privacy on the issue.</span><br />
&nbsp;<br />
<span style="font-weight: 400">If you still feel strongly that you are able and qualified to advise her on the issue of remarriage, tread carefully and employ wisdom and understanding.</span><br />
&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="5">
<li><b> Don’t unknowingly leave her out</b></li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<span style="font-weight: 400">Losing a beloved spouse leaves a widow feeling emotionally raw. Everything she hears and reads has the potential to cause those unhelpful and difficult feelings to resurface. While we should always be careful regarding what we say to people, be extra vigilant when you are interacting with her.</span><br />
&nbsp;<br />
<span style="font-weight: 400">For example, did you just invite a widow and single mother to an event with “</span><b>no children allowed</b><span style="font-weight: 400">” boldly listed on the invitation? To you it might not seem like an issue, but to someone who has lost her husband and doesn’t necessarily have access to any other regular or trusted babysitter, this could leave her feeling alienated. Make an effort to include her and her children in your activities, even if you’d rather have a child-free event.</span><br />
&nbsp;<br />
<span style="font-weight: 400">Take the time to contemplate her situation and include her in your events and gatherings.</span><br />
&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="6">
<li><b> Offer financial help – tactfully and respectfully</b></li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<span style="font-weight: 400">Losing a spouse may sometimes mean losing the family’s breadwinner. But offering a widow a pile of cold, hard cash might embarrass her or make her feel uneasy. We are commanded by Allah (swt) to care for widows and orphans in our community, but we are also encouraged to always give in a way that honours the recipient.</span><br />
&nbsp;<br />
<span style="font-weight: 400">Some people are very well meaning – they ask widows openly whether they need financial assistance. While that is admirable, more often than not, the widow will reply with a resounding “no,” even if she </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">is</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> need.</span><br />
&nbsp;<br />
<span style="font-weight: 400">It is imperative to provide help to widows and their children while still protecting their honour and dignity. So, be a good listener. Find out where she shops for her kids and get her a gift card. Is she having trouble with her old phone or computer but can’t afford a new one? Buy her one as a gift and say, “I noticed you were having trouble with your laptop, so me and a few friends chipped in to get you this new one!” Instead of being embarrassed, she will be happy that a) you noticed and listened, and b) you were caring enough to give her a </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">gift</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">, instead of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">charity</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">.</span><br />
&nbsp;<br />
<span style="font-weight: 400">May Allah (swt) grant relief and comfort to the widows and orphans of our communities, and may He abundantly reward those who seek to help and support them.</span><br />
&nbsp;<br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Written by: Sophia Ali</h3>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<em>Iddah</em> is a word that most Muslim women cringe at upon hearing. It is welcomed by most women with confusion, closed heartedness, bitterness, resentment, and the dread of how<strong> l-o-n-g</strong> it will take.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Our non-muslim friends may ask, “What? What’s iddah? Why do you have to do that?” We generally respond with, “Oh, it’s just a waiting period to make sure we aren’t pregnant.” It’s something we have to pencil into our planners or input into our iPhones like a doctor’s appointment. Once it starts, the countdown begins! We happily cross off each day knowing we are 24 hours closer to being a “free” woman.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
I know there will be people who read this article and will quote verses saying, “Oh, but<em> it is</em> about making sure you aren’t pregnant. No man wants to marry a woman and find out she is carrying another man’s child. Think of the rights of fathers and children!” Though this is true, I am challenging you to open your mind, as a woman or as a man, and try to understand that this is surface level wisdom.<br />
<strong>What lies below the surface is much deeper and pierces the heart, mind, and soul.</strong><br />
&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Terminology is Everything</h4>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
I do have one issue or complaint about<em> iddah</em>: the way it is defined in English. Most translate <em>iddah</em> as a “waiting period.&#8221; The term “waiting” is absolutely dreadful! The word itself invokes terror for most.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<em>Waiting</em>, <em>waiting</em> room, <em>waiting</em> in line, <em>waiting</em> for a doctor, <em>waiting</em> in the emergency room, <em>waiting</em> for summer vacation; <em>waiting</em> is associated with so many negative situations. Waiting is sedentary &#8211; staying in one place, not doing anything, all of which sound horrible to any woman who is single and lonely! We, as women, just don’t react to emotional stress like this- we do the opposite.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
I think we need to find a better way to translate<em> iddah</em> into English &#8211; this will be half the battle. I believe if we call it a “recuperating” period, “me-time” period, “finding yourself again” period, or even a “healing period”, it is a million times better than a “waiting” period!<br />
&nbsp;<br />
I believe as women we are much more emotional and susceptible to words than men are &#8211; we are constantly analyzing them when others speak &#8211; so of course when we are put into what feels like a time-out corner and told to wait, we stomp and scream and say no! “I don’t wanna! Why should I when he doesn’t have to?! It’s not fair!”<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Naturally our defenses go up, battle-walls built in rage, and nothing can change our damaged hearts and minds when we are already in a sensational, unstable emotional state. We need to address our emotionally vulnerable women properly and use an interpretation/translation that will build them up and empower them as women.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Let me give you an example which most people can sympathize with: When a woman leaves work to give birth we don’t call it a “waiting” period &#8211; we call it <em>maternity leave</em>. Yes, she is waiting to have her baby, and to be healed enough to get back to work, but again, “waiting” just doesn’t resonate with us nor express what is happening on a deeper level.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
The literal meaning of the Old Arabic word iddah is “to keep count”. Unfortunately, the predominantly male scholars have come up with the terminology we now use today for iddah which is “waiting period”.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
From their male perspective, this is what it is perceived and communicated to us: mere waiting to see the status of our womb. From a female perspective, however, there is so much more depth and breadth to <em>iddah</em>, so to have this label slapped on that she is just “waiting”, “it’s just to protect her honor”, etc.- is too simple and even oppressive.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Why wait then?</h4>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
The concept and implementation of <em>iddah</em> has seemed oppressive, up until this past week of my life. <strong>I used to envision<em> iddah</em> as this black hole of stagnant time, but now I see it as a retreat for soothing the soul.</strong> A time to focus on my relationship with God.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
It truly saddens me that so many of our women have lost the deep meaning of<em> iddah</em>, along with this merciful time in their life without getting healing and love from the Divine when they most need it.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Let’s get real for a second: with all of our modern day science, <em>iddah</em> is something we no longer have to observe just to prove we are not pregnant. We can implement various forms of birth control, DNA testing, and get back into the game of searching for love much quicker than a few months. We feel like we shouldn’t have to have an <em>iddah</em> because we have desires just like men do and they don’t have to wait.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
May God forgive us and guide us all. Truth be told, I don’t know any woman going through or anticipating their iddah who did NOT have this conversation in their mind or with a close girlfriend. This argument is out there and rampant nowadays because we have lost the true mercy and beauty of God’s commandments.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Allah’s Wisdom Above Ours</h4>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
If this is what we have minimized and marginalized Allah’s command to observe <em>iddah</em> as something so easy to be thrown out of our deen/sunnah (as something that only has scientific surface value), then it is NOT what we think it is, ladies! There is so much more wisdom and mercy behind this God-given decree. We just have to put on our God-conscious spectacles to see what’s truly there in our midst: <strong>A gift. A gift from the Most Loving, Most Merciful Lord of the Worlds.</strong><br />
&nbsp;<br />
As we read in the Quran 2:186,</p>
<blockquote><p>“God wills that you shall have ease, and does not will you to suffer hardship; but [Allah/God desires] that you complete the number [of days required], and that you extol God for being divinely guided, and that you render your thanks [unto Allah/God].”</p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
If we truly believe that one of the names of Allah (subhannahu wa ta’ala) is <em>Al-Aleem</em>, a.k.a. “The All-Knowing, The Omniscient” then it is easy to accept <em>iddah</em> as something full of beauty and wisdom and not cultural baggage &#8211; or worse &#8211; archaic. Allah knows the tiniest details of all things hidden and manifest. The knowledge of Allah is complete, perfect, and covers the past, present, and future.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><p>“And it becometh not a believing man or a believing woman, when Allah and His messenger have decided an affair (for them), that they should (after that) claim any say in their affair; and whoso is rebellious to Allah and His messenger, he verily goeth astray in error manifest.” &#8211; Qur’an 33:36</p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
We need to try our best to have our thoughts, actions, and worship of Allah align with our beliefs as Muslimahs. The truth is we are all human who are made in weakness to turn to Allah. I encourage you to embrace your iddah as a time to reconnect with Allah the Protective Friend (Al-Wali), The Loving One (Al-Wadood), and The Comforter (Al Mumeen).<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Focusing on Allah and creating a stronger foundation of iman can only help you stand strong in this time of iddah and going forward, insha’Allah. Asking Allah for Guidance, clarity, and wisdom to make the right decisions and believing Allah will respond to you is very helpful during this healing period.<br />
&nbsp;<br />

		<description><![CDATA[Written By: Heba Alshareef &#160; &#160; Helen Keller was an insightful woman. Having been the first deaf-blind [&#8230;]]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Written By: Heba Alshareef</h3>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Helen Keller was an insightful woman. Having been the first deaf-blind to earn a Bachelors of Arts Degree, her experiences and struggles made her observations about life so poignant, that they are still quoted and pondered decades after her death. As an example of her uncanny reflections, she says: “When one door of happiness closes, another opens, but often we look so long at the closed door that we do not see the one which has been opened for us.”<br />
&nbsp;<br />
And it’s true. In studies of happy people, it is commonly found that they do not subscribe to “if only” fantasies. This means that they don’t find themselves wallowing in the sort of faulty thinking that often sounds something like this: “If only I had a million dollars, I would be happy,” or “if only I lost 30 pounds, I would be happy.” Putting conditions on your happiness can mean that you believe that you are not worthy of being happy – for even when you fulfil those conditions, you still do not measure up. How many have a million dollars and are still unhappy? How many have perfectly svelte bodies, but are still unhappy?<br />
&nbsp;<br />
So then, what of those who find themselves unable to get past something that has happened to make them unhappy? What of those who’ve suffered a loss so great that, no matter how much they’d like to, they can’t believe that the day will come when they’ll be happy again? How can they move on and see that the train they’ve been forced on might actually be a better fit for them than the one they were forced to abandon?<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Hasna (not her real name) is one of these people. Having been engaged for a long time to a man who was not psychologically or financially ready for marriage but one who she felt obliged to hold false hopes for, she found it difficult to fathom the idea that she might have a different life than the miserable one she believed was her destiny.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
It was a lengthy process, but Hasna had to take back the reins, to take a stand and stand firm in order to change the direction of her life. Sure, she had to make hard decisions, take realistic steps to move on, but it was that first step, the decision to stop staring at the closed door of happiness, that would prove to be the most difficult.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Here are some thoughts that helped Hasna take that first step and that should help others struggling to get past unhappiness do the same:<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<h4>1. Trust in Allah (SWT)</h4>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
Trust that Allah knows best and that no matter how bad things get, “verily with hardship comes ease. Verily with hardship comes ease.” (Al Quran, 94:6).<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Know that everything shall pass. It’s a real relief to be able to let your mind rest assured that Allah will take care of it – that He will see the situation to its end result without your fretting over it.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<h4>2. Set a deadline</h4>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
Realise that you choose your reactions and that, consequently, feeling happy is within your reach. Realise that if you avert your eyes from the closed door, you can start seeing the open one in its place. We can’t control what situations or tests will come our way, but we can control how we react to them. If we feel like we need a mourning period, so be it, but the act of putting a deadline on it puts us back in control. In Hasna’s case, she had to give her fiancé and his family an ultimatum that had a fair timetable – “If he is still unable to marry by x date, then I’ll have to move on” – gave her a tangible day in which to get past that closed door.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<h4>3. Pamper yourself</h4>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
In the time it takes to deal with the closed door of happiness, we can learn to view disappointment as an opportunity to lay back, to learn to love ourselves so that we learn to better deal with such situations. In the case of Hasna, she’d become so ridden with guilt and a sense of duty and obligation that she couldn’t fathom the fact that her fiancé was not her husband – that technically she didn’t owe him anything. When her father decided to step in and told her to break off the engagement, she actually disobeyed him for awhile. Islamically, her father had more rights upon her, but her inability to let go of mistreating herself didn’t let her see this. Allah (SWT) “wants ease for you and not hardship.” (Al Quran, 2:185)<br />
&nbsp;<br />
When people realise this, they will learn that the act of pampering themselves can be a good thing. Buy yourself a gourmet coffee on occasion, sleep extra long on a Saturday morning, take a bubble bath. By treating ourselves well, we are better able to move past situations that can harm us.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<h4>4. Journal the positives</h4>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
Getting into the habit of keeping a journal, or putting pen to paper as it pertains to problems in our lives, and learning how to uncover strategies for better living, can be a lifesaver. A journal title entry that looks something like “100 reasons why this unhappy situation is actually a happy one” can be great motivation to move past the closed door in your life. You have to put your mind to work, to look at the situation from another angle, to think of the positives. Then read and re-read your journal entries until they are ingrained in your psyche.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<h4>5. Learn something new</h4>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
When you’re in a situation that makes you feel stuck, it’s imperative to learn to be flexible, to realise that curiosity is a pathway to a new normal. And who knows, your new knowledge might be the beginning of a much better normal. With Hasna, in the middle of her traumatic situation with her fiancé, she took up baking. She perfected her baklava recipe and her chiffon cakes. To avoid eating it all, she would contribute to sisterly gatherings or community fund- raisers. Her desserts didn’t have her opening a bakery, but they did pave the way for some great friendships. Maybe more importantly, she gained the confidence to know that, when push comes to shove, she can triumph by transforming herself, that she can choose to pour herself into something different, something sweet.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
It’s that openness to sweetness, the sort of faith that deaf-blind Helen Keller talks about, that could enable us to walk through the open door of happiness that was there all along.<br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Written By: Aishah Adams</h3>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong><br />
I have been through divorce. <em>Twice</em>.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am done trying to cover up the perceived shame that often comes with being divorced. I am done trying to give anyone the opportunity to validate my being an upright Muslimah.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It was a bright almost sunny day in May. The tell-tale signs of summer were lurking around the corner and I was sitting in a class alongside other Public health professionals discussing the concept of Stigmatisation when my idea for SIDDIQAH was born.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before that class was done I was clear on what I was going to do, though I took a year to figure out how I was going to go about it. Empathy is one of my biggest strengths and giving back to the Ummah has been one of my biggest dreams- in my bid to combine both, Siddiqah started to grow. Though Siddiqah is far from where I hope it would be by now, I strongly belief that the sky is the lowest step on this journey of leaving behind a legacy that would continue to benefit Muslimahs till the end of time InshaAllaah!<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<h4>What is <span style="color: #993366"><a style="color: #993366" href="http://siddiqah.org" target="_blank">SIDDIQAH</a></span>?</h4>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
SIDDIQAH is a non-governmental organisation that supports widows, divorcees and struggling families. It was set-up some 3+ years ago by me, Aishah Adams. At the time I set it up, I barely had funds to push forward but I believed in the beauty of the work and more importantly I put my trust in Allah and took solace in His words of being sufficient for the believers and with this in mind, I started operations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #993366"><a style="color: #993366" href="https://www.facebook.com/siddiqahcic/?fref=ts" target="_blank">SIDDIQAH</a></span> has 3 arms: Support, Empowerment, and Health promotion and education. Through the support arm, we provide psychological, emotional, and sometimes financial support. Our financial support depends on money donated to the organisation which isn’t much as we tend to leverage on help from family, friends and well-wishers. We try to be there for our sisters going through these trials both through words and actions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Abraham Lincoln once said “You cannot help people permanently by doing for them, what they could and should do for themselves.”</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To exemplify this philosophy, we try to help our sisters get back on their feet after the trial that has just ripped their stability into shreds by working at helping them become financially independent. We provide financial aid to help set them up in business or we link them up with those who can assist with employment. This task is often very difficult, especially in cases where she barely had something going before all the living responsibilities fell on her shoulders. Our empowerment efforts are usually tailored to fit the person being empowered as ‘one peg doesn’t always fit all’.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our health promotion arm focuses on some specific health issues such as stress, anxiety, and depression, just to mention a few. Here we try to educate people on what to look out for, and we share tips on how to work through them. This arm has been underdeveloped so far but starting October 2016, InshaAllah, we hope to hold health education talks once a month, <em>wallaahu musta’an</em>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Why did I start SIDDIQAH?</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I was going through my trials as a divorcee, I used to hear people say to me, “MashaAllah, you’re such a strong person” and “I don’t know what I would have done if I was in your shoes.” Then I used to think, ‘If I am strong- or perceived as strong- and I have it this tough (and I had it really tough) how would those who don’t have that much strength cope? How would they learn to ignore sly comments and criticisms and more importantly the perceived shame that follows divorce the moment word gets out?’ This motivated me to support sisters going through divorce and, more importantly, all those who have been through ‘iddah and were trying to remain a part of the society.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>SIDDIQAH helped me heal as working to help others predisposed me to getting first hand accounts of their life stories too and <strong>this helped me realise that there was always something to be grateful for no matter how bad it seemed. It helped me increase in thankfulness and gratitude to Allah.</strong> It helped me decide to take action and more importantly put in hard work and be successful so that I could inspire others to be high achievers irrespective of whatever life throws at them by way of trials.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>How has SIDDIQAH been of benefit to others?</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Alhamdulilah we have been able to support about 60 families going through divorce, spousal death or very strenuous financial challenges.</strong> Over the past 3 years, we have helped raise money for housing, school fees, health care, and start-up costs for business in our bid to support our sisters. In these 3+ years, I have seen many sisters come to me being very down-cast and leave us with renewed hope. I have seen sisters going through divorce move from a state of helplessness to being purpose-driven and determined to get back on their feet.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Along the way three of our beneficiaries have gotten back on their feet, Alhamdulilah. Though three successful transitions in three years seems awfully small, we are hopeful that more sisters will become strengthened through the support we give. We are now trying to broaden our financial support base to accommodate more funding opportunities. Like many non-governmental organisations, funding has been one of the biggest challenges we have faced in supporting our sisters to make the transition from being dependent to being able to stand on their feet again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In our bid to help change the stigma associated with divorce, we share messages on our social media pages as well as organise events in which some of our beneficiaries are invited to share their story. One such event was held in November of 2014, and it was quite insightful for those who attended.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Vision &amp; Plans for the Future</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In order to re-orient and educate more Muslims on the topic of divorce, and in an attempt to make people understand the pain those experiencing divorce go through- including both the psychological and health effects- SIDDIQAH has a short documentary in the works titled ‘The Elephant in the Room’. It is currently in the editing process. Stay glued to this website as well as our social media pages for more updates on this project.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Due to challenges with funding, we have been unable to spread our wings as far as we hoped. Some of our plans for the future include having tea parties in which sisters who are looking to get married get to hang out with those who are married or divorced and learn from them. We hope that this will be an opportunity for more young sisters looking to get married to learn and avoid the pitfalls that led others into making certain mistakes that inadvertently led to divorce or frustration in their marriages.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>SIDDIQAH has a few dedicated volunteers and staff and are now looking to expand our work-force to better serve the growing number of beneficiaries. We are also trying to find sponsors who would be willing to support our work on a monthly basis; this would help us reach out to more Muslimahs suffering from the pangs of divorce or widowhood or facing huge financial setbacks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once I received a message from one of our beneficiaries and she wrote <strong>‘Please help me fish and stop giving me the fish. Though I appreciate the help and support, I would prefer to stand on my own. Help me set-up my business idea.’</strong> If we receive more funding, we plan to be able to financially support at least 5 sisters every month to set up their business; that way we can increase productivity amongst our sisters and cut down on the rate of dependency that seems to be on the increase.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are also looking to rent an apartment that would serve as a stepping stone for those who were thrown out of their homes abruptly. Once I received a call from a sister who had just gotten divorced and had perhaps a week to move out. Alhamdulilah we were able to raise funds to get her another apartment, but this ease doesn’t happen all the time. At the moment, we are trying to raise funds for a sister who is divorced with four kids and is about to be thrown out of the apartment she has been staying in due to lack of funds to pay her rent. If SIDDIQAH had a stand-by apartment to house people, it would take the stress off of us when we have these kinds of emergencies with no clear idea of where the funds will come from.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are also looking at running a radio show in partnership with enRadio, an online Muslim radio station which is a sub of eNarrate (www.enarrate.com). The radio show is intended to touch on issues surrounding marriage and divorce as well as the plight of those who are divorced. It’s intended to be used as a tool to re-educate people.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Breaking the Stigma</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I remember speaking to a certain sister some years back and at the time I was trying to gather resources for the documentary (though I didn’t end up shooting it then). I asked her, “Did you know that Khadijah (radiyallaahu anha) was married three times?” and her jaw literally dropped and she asked, “<em>Three times?!</em>” One could hear the sound of incredulity in her voice and I calmly replied, “Yes, three times.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My point to this sister wasn’t just that she was married three times. Rather, <strong>her success was linked with her third husband, the Nabi of Allah</strong> (sallallaahu alayhi wassalam) and not with any of her previous ones who were disbelievers, as was the case with many before the revelation descended. In fact, if you were to look through the seerah and the books of hadith, you would come across many stories of divorce that happened in the time of the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wassalam) and even afterwards. Does this indicate in any way that the Sahabah (radiyallaahu anhum) who went through divorce were lesser in piety than those who didn’t? NO. Divorce is just one of the many trials in the life of this world and Allah tests whom He wills with what He wills, as Allah is indeed the Wise, the Best of Planners.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Staying married for many years doesn’t necessarily mean you’re having a successful marriage. There are numerous long-term marriages in which the occupants are in deep misery, the children included. Being divorced is one of the many trials that people go through in life and just as the one who loses a child or goes through a miscarriage doesn’t necessarily plan to put themselves through pain when they learn of their pregnancy, so also a divorcee doesn’t start out in a marriage looking forward to getting divorced.</p>

<p>If one wouldn’t mock or stigmatise such people, why then do people often single out divorcees with children- and even widows- and treat them like they aren’t a part of the community? There are people who invested themselves completely in their marriage and still got divorced, and there are people who gave little yet had successful marriages. True success is from Allaah alone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>DISCLAIMER: This support group is in NO WAY, directly or otherwise trying to encourage divorce. This is a humble effort on our path to support our sisters through this trial because we believe it to be a traumatic time in the life of the one going through this hardship and we believe that it is meritorious to lend a helping hand to those going through this painful process.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The small kindnesses,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The tender mercies,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The moments of joy,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The flashes</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> of relief</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Don&#8217;t make up for the loss.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Not entirely.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But they help.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">They help to remind you</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That you have permission to smile,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">To feel joy</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And love</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And gratitude,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In spite of the loss,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Or maybe because of it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Because with every difficulty,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There is ease</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If we open our arms</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">To embrace it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">His promise is true.</span></p>
