				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3><strong>Written by: Fatima Asmal</strong></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At the end of the day, we are all but human.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">I was always obsessed with the idea of marriage. </span><span style="font-weight: 400">Before my first marriage, I wanted to marry and I did. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For six years after that ended, I was even more obsessed with the idea of getting married.  So much so, that I married a man who had already proven himself to be extremely abusive during our engagement period. Verily with every difficulty comes ease, and from that miserable situation my son, Amr, my greatest blessing was born.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The obsession started to wane thereafter but didn&#8217;t completely leave me, and a few years after that I married yet again&#8230;</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Again, not the wisest of choices of a partner, and when I was asked to make a choice between that unstable marriage and my son, I chose Amr.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I never looked back thereafter. The desire for male companionship which had always prevailed within me died, and I focused all my energies on my son, parents, close friends, and my two careers &#8211; one in journalism and the other in running a charity I founded called &#8220;ILM-SA.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But like I said, we are all human.  And every now and then &#8211; ever so seldom- I do reflect about the way my life has turned out &#8211; living at my parents&#8217; home with them and my son.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once, a couple of years ago, I had to have my mum admitted into the hospital. This entailed taking her from our family doctor to her specialist and then sitting for hours in a waiting room trying to arrange for her medical aid and admission.  My son was a lot younger and anxious. I had to ask my best friend to babysit him. Rush home, pack my mummy&#8217;s bag, rush back. I had to somehow work him into the equation because he didn&#8217;t want to be away from me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then there was the time Amr was severely dehydrated. Again, a friend was asked to take me to a doctor.  Another friend was summoned to take us to the hospital.  She &#8211; may Allah Reward her &#8211; swiped her credit card at admission (yes his father reimbursed her later on but that was not an overnight process or one free of interrogation). I remained at his side at the hospital, talking him through procedures. Packing us clothes and essentials was the responsibility of my mum, may Allah bless her.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Recently, after a wedding, we were at my aunt&#8217;s house, when my mother starting throwing up and feeling extremely dizzy. By the time everyone had left, she was unable to stand up unassisted due to her blood pressure and sugar levels being abnormally high. At close to midnight or perhaps thereafter, I called my cousin who is our family doctor and she got out bed, accompanied by her son, to check on mum.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mum had to stay at my aunty&#8217;s house that night, and so there for the umpteenth time in my life you had me, a single woman (and not the best of drivers) driving along on not the safest routes to get home. There were rocks on some parts of the road, puddles and potholes elsewhere. And since I am but human, I wondered, <em>&#8220;How different would my life me if I was married to a decent human being?&#8221;</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My little man seated next to me brought me out of that thinking. He told me when to drive slowly and how to avoid dodgy parts of the road. At home, he locked the gates and turned off all the lights. He told me he loved me. He cuddled me till he fell into a deep sleep.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Few people in my close family have ever deemed it appropriate to introduce me to anyone. I was always labeled ‘lazy’ (because I&#8217;m not a chef) and ‘big mouth’ (because I speak my mind).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the wedding I mentioned earlier, a female family member suggested she introduce me to someone who was also attending. I declined because it is not the right time for Amr and I currently, but I was touched.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"><em>“What do these incidents have to do with anything?”</em> you may be asking.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, I feel that there are very few non-judgmental people in our community, people who recognize that it is possible for a woman not to be entirely responsible for her three failed marriages. People who recognize that a lack of love for the kitchen doesn&#8217;t equate to a lack of love in a woman&#8217;s heart. People who equate straight-forward-ness with sincerity and not having a big mouth. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As Amr grows older and these incidents like mum and him getting ill occur, I do concede that some day I may elect to marry again and perhaps when that day arrives Allah will send forth a non-judgmental individual, open-hearted enough to introduce me to a mature, open-hearted, generous man for whom marriage is much, much more than sexual gratification.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For now, I must say I would not have come this far in one piece without a close-friend who has really over-extended herself in our regard, without my mum, without my dad, without my Amr, without Allah, and without the Good Samaritan matchmakers who remind me that I am still human.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3><strong>Written by: Na&#8217;ima b. Robert</strong></h3>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>A part of me died four months and ten days ago.</strong><br />
But, alhamdulillah, it wasn&#8217;t hope. It wasn&#8217;t courage. And it definitely wasn&#8217;t faith and trust in my Lord&#8217;s perfect plan.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>The call that changed everything</h3>
<p>The call woke me before Fajr. My heart stopped as I tried to recognize the number on the screen. A blank. But when I answered the phone and heard the familiar voice of the doctor on the other side, I prepared myself for the worst.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
And the worst came: heart stopped beating, CPR attempted for 30 minutes, no hope.<br />
‘JazakAllahu khairan,’ I whispered hoarsely before cutting off the call. Then I immediately rose from the bed and fell into sujood of shukr. Alhamdulillah.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
It was the moment I had dreaded but also a moment I had been preparing myself for, ever since a sister, who had come to visit me at the hospital, had told me the story of a husband and wife whose daughter was desperately ill. Every time they came to the hospital, the doctors would tell them more reasons why she was not going to make it. And, at every visit, the father would turn to his wife and said, ‘Don’t forget.’<br />
This continued for several days, the doctors predicting the worst, and the husband reminding his wife not to forget, until the day they arrived and were given the news that would break any parent’s heart: <strong>their daughter had died.</strong><br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>Upon hearing the news, the husband turned to his wife and said to her, ‘Now,’ and they both fell into sujood of shukr.</strong><br />
&nbsp;<br />
The hospital staff were amazed, some of them even horrified. Surely this was a terribly sad event, one to be wept over, to be mourned, not to be celebrated with sujood?<br />
They asked the couple why, why had they done this?<br />
&nbsp;<br />
And the couple told the staff at that hospital how they had taken the decision to give thanks for their daughter’s life, for the joy she had brought them, for the love they had shared with her. Allah SWT had allowed them to love and care for her for all those years: <strong>should they not give thanks for this?</strong><br />
&nbsp;<br />
And, when I heard this story, I decided that that was what I was going to do, if it ever came to that.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Because, you see, <strong>I had no right to bemoan losing my husband, after being gifted with more happiness in 16 years than many taste in a several lifetimes.</strong> Alhamdulillah, Allah SWT guided us both to Islam and, a few short years later, to each other. My husband’s understanding and patient attitude brought out the best in me, in deen and dunyah. His way was not to command or force, but rather guide and, even, let me make my own mistakes and learn from them. As with those he worked with, his aim was always to support me in fulfilling my potential, because it was that quality that had drawn him to me in the first place (his words, not mine!). Quite simply, we understood each other, we supported each other, we were best friends and allies, as well as husband and wife. <strong>It is no exaggeration to say that, without him, I would not be the woman I am today.</strong> It was for this reason that I dedicated From My Sisters’ Lips to him, all those years ago: ‘For the wind beneath my wings’. I always prayed that any good I had done would be counted in the scale of his good deeds.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
As it was, Allah SWT took him after a bout of illness, after completing the Hajj twice (the last time, with me) and having recently taken all his children for ‘Umrah. He died a Muslim, on tawheed, in the land of the Muslims, well-loved by his family, friends and colleagues. Alhamdulillah, some things are indeed a comfort.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<h3>A deep and terrible loss</h3>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
In the days that followed his passing, I was on autopilot. There is no time for breaking down when you are a foreign national, trying to complete paperwork for a burial, on the day the British Embassy is closed for a UK holiday. I went through the motions: I Whatsapp&#8217;ed everyone to give them the news, I sat on the phone to try to get an appointment to allow his body to be buried in Egypt, as he would have wanted; I stood in crowded offices while my papers were shuffled back and forth, collecting stamps and signatures along the way.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
By the time we had finally got permission to bury him, we were late: the Dhuhr prayer was in less than an hour. My phone was dead. I knew that I wouldn’t be able to let people know about the Janazah in time. But, by that time, I was past caring.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
I observed the Janazah salah from the steps of the masjid and I said my last salaam to him in the courtyard before they took him on the long drive to the graveyard.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Surrounded by my children, my family, my in-laws, sisters, brothers, colleagues and well-wishers on every side, I felt like I was watching a scene in a movie. I played my part well: I was the gracious widow, receiving condolences, comforting others, maintaining my composure, but, in truth, my heart was aching. And yet, through it all, my faith in Allah SWT was undaunted, alhamdulillah.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
I wrote at the time: <em>I feel so incredibly blessed. Even in the midst of the trial, as the tears fall, I am surrounded by His Mercy. The du&#8217;as, the support, the love, the sense of strength and serenity, are all signs of His Mercy. Alhamdulillah, I accept. Alhamdulillah, I am at peace. Alhamdulillah, alhamdulillah, alhamdulillah is the balm for my aching heart.</em><br />
&nbsp;<br />
The next challenge, after burying him, would be mourning him, observing the ‘iddah&#8230;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />

		<description><![CDATA[Written by: Na&#8217;ima B. Robert (Read Part 1 ) &#160; &#160; Observing the ‘iddah &#160; There is [&#8230;]]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Written by: Na&#8217;ima B. Robert</h3>
<p>(Read <span style="color: #993366"><a style="color: #993366" href="http://my-iddah.com/on-iddah-by-naima-b-robert-part-1/" target="_blank">Part 1</a> </span>)<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Observing the ‘iddah</h3>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
There is a delicate tension in the state of &#8216;<em>iddah</em>, the mourning period for a widow.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
On the one hand, life continues, particularly if you have children or have to work to support your family. Contrary to popular belief, <span style="text-decoration: underline">it is permitted for the widow in ‘iddah to go out during the day to fulfil her needs</span>*. The pressures, demands and responsibilities of the world are real and they won&#8217;t wait for four months and ten days to be over. Some widows find that family members take over these tasks but, in many cases, you are forced to plan, to look forward, to move on, to face the world. It can be an exquisite distraction from the pain that lies buried deep under the school run, bedtime stories and endless paperwork and deadlines. But it is still a distraction.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
On the other hand, your state of ‘iddah restricts you; you cannot fully embrace life, even if you want to. You are not supposed to wear beautiful clothes or adorn yourself in any way. Although you may have visitors and spend time with family and friends, you are expected to shun social gatherings. You are not to entertain proposals. You should observe your period of mourning in your marital home. All this means that you must pause. You must reflect. You must withdraw.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
You must face the reality, brave the darkness: the ache, the loneliness, the anger, the fear, that feeling of being utterly bereft. You must face it because it will break you down, bring you to your knees, make you feel once again that vulnerability of his last days when you would have given anything for one last apology, one last kiss, one last promise.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
You must face the reality that this is Allah&#8217;s plan for you. And that, if this is so, there <em>must</em> be khair in it for you. It&#8217;s there. It&#8217;s there in the chance to ask for forgiveness, to pour your heart out, to cleanse, to rectify your soul, to purify your habits, to be ready to emerge from your ‘iddah like a butterfly from a chrysalis: reborn, refashioned, beautiful.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<h3>The gift of ‘iddah</h3>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
For me, my ‘iddah has been a time of discovery, full of challenges, but, equally, full of triumphs. So far, I have weathered the storm. We all have, alhamdulillah.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
During my ‘iddah, I have tasted grief, a grief unlike any I have felt before. At times, I have felt a crushing and desperate loneliness, a longing for my love that threatens to suffocate me. But then I breathe, one beat, two beats, and it is soothed: Allah SWT sends me relief in the form of an ayah, or a poem, or a phone call or a sister dropping by out of the blue to listen and hold my hand and let me know that it is ok to feel.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
I have also felt, as many widows do, the weight of new responsibilities, too numerous to name. <strong>The realisation that it is all down to you now, that you are a single parent, that there is no escape from the responsibility, is a terrifying one. </strong>I have also felt the confusion, the anger, the sadness that all widows must feel.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
But, equally, with every test, Allah SWT has shown me the truth of His words: <em>‘Verily with every difficulty, there is ease.</em>’ I have held onto those words; they have kept me from drowning many, many times. By His grace, I have felt the love of so many kind and goodhearted souls who have been there for me, sometimes traveling great distances, to take the kids, to make me a cup of tea, to listen to me, to let me cry and to let me sleep for two days straight. May Allah SWT reward them with Jannat-ul-Firdaws; they have taught me the true meaning of sisterhood. I have felt the love that radiates from my children, my family and from those I do not know a thousand miles away; I have felt the thrill of strength and determination as I continue to walk forward and achieve the goals I have set for myself, for our family; and I have felt the healing balm of gratitude that continues to sustain me.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
If it is not improper to say so, I would say that <strong>I eventually found my ‘iddah period empowering</strong>. By Allah’s grace, I have been able to come to terms with and accept that my husband is no longer with us. I have come to accept and embrace the challenges that this new journey will bring. I am at peace with the decree of Allah SWT. Allah SWT promises that He will never burden a soul more than it can bear – that alone gives me the courage and confidence I need to meet the numerous challenges head-on. I know in my heart of hearts, with full yaqeen, that He did not test us with this to break us, but rather, to purify us, to lift us up. He has been my solace throughout this test and I have never once despaired of His Mercy. Alhamdulillah, He has never failed to come to my aid in my time of need. He has never failed to ‘catch me’. And He never will, bi’idhnillah.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<em>Alhamdulillah ‘ala kulli haal.</em><br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<em>Sweet stoicism</em><br />
<em> Stifles the screams,</em><br />
<em> Silences the sighs,</em><br />
<em> Sinks the soul</em><br />
<em> To numbness.</em><br />
<em> My heart is too hard to hurt.</em><br />
<em> My hands, too full to face the sky.</em><br />
<em> My eyes, too focused to tear up</em><br />
<em> With wild, wilful tears.</em><br />
<em> Forgive me, Lord.</em><br />
<em> Forgive me</em><br />
<em> And catch me</em><br />
<em> When my back finally breaks</em><br />
<em> When my heart finally cracks</em><br />
<em> When the tears finally fall</em><br />
<em> And fall</em><br />
<em> And fall,</em><br />
<em> Drowning me</em><br />
<em> And all my patience,</em><br />
<em> Strength</em><br />
<em> And fortitude.</em><br />
<em> When the agony of loss</em><br />
<em> Threatens to throw me from the cliff,</em><br />
<em> Catch me, Lord.</em><br />
<em> Catch me.</em><br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />

&nbsp;<br />
<strong>We asked you, the readers, to share with us some tips on having a blessed solo &#8216;Eid. </strong><br />
&nbsp;<br />
These last 10 nights of Ramadan, we have been sharing some of these tips on enjoying &#8216;Eid al Fitr as a single woman, divorced or widowed, or not yet married at all.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Here are just a few of the bits of advice you had for your sisters.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
(Note: In case you missed the tips, make sure you are following us on our <span style="color: #993366"><a style="color: #993366" href="https://www.facebook.com/myiddah/" target="_blank">Facebook page</a></span>, as well as <span style="color: #993366"><a style="color: #993366" href="https://www.instagram.com/my_iddah/" target="_blank">Instagram</a> @my_iddah</span> &amp; <span style="color: #993366"><a style="color: #993366" href="https://twitter.com/MyIddah" target="_blank">Twitter</a> @MyIddah</span>.)<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Tip #2: Be Proactive! Make Plans. Don&#8217;t wait on anyone else to plan your &#8216;Eid for you.</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://my-iddah.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Be-proactive-1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-504 size-medium" src="http://my-iddah.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Be-proactive-1-300x300.jpg" alt="Be proactive (1)" width="300" height="300" /></a><br />
&nbsp;<br />
Many of us find &#8216;Eid a challenge every year, single or not. Things are especially hard for those of us who live in areas lacking other Muslims, or those of us who are converts and lack the support of a Muslim family structure. However, we cannot simply lie down and give up! &#8216;Eid is Allah&#8217;s gift to <strong>you. </strong>You must make the most of it, and it&#8217;s your right and responsibility to enjoy this blessed time in whatever way you choose, assuming of course that it&#8217;s <em>halaal</em>.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Tip #4: Treat Yourself</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><a href="http://my-iddah.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/treat-yourself.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-516 size-medium" src="http://my-iddah.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/treat-yourself-300x300.jpg" alt="treat yourself" width="300" height="300" /></a></h3>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<span style="color: #993366"><a style="color: #993366" href="https://www.facebook.com/naima.b.robert?fref=ufi"><b>Na&#8217;ima B. Robert</b></a></span><span style="font-weight: 400"> says, “</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Be kind to yourself&#8230;Do something nice for yourself: buy yourself a gift, have a bubble bath, invite a few wonderful friends over, tidy up, light candles, cook a lovely meal and talk about all you have to be grateful for and all that you hope to achieve in the coming year. If you have children, create something beautiful with them: a piece of artwork, a group poem, a funny video. Say no to housework for the day and veg out with the kids, play with them, watch something funny, have a treasure hunt, a midnight feast. Then put them to bed and curl up with a lovely bar of chocolate and a good book</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">.”</span><br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<i><span style="font-weight: 400">“Focus on YOU”</span></i> <b>Nazneen S</b></span><span style="font-weight: 400">. says,  </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">“because if you feel even a little bit better, your whole attitude changes positively and the people around you (especially any children) react to that too. I learnt the hard way that I need to make myself happy/calm first, so that i can then make the kiddies happy and calm. </span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400">If not, buy yourself some nice presents, indulge in a good book, watch a movie/start a series, order a takeout. Do whatever it takes to make you feel better.”</span></i><br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Tip #5: Arrange not to be alone</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><a href="http://my-iddah.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Tip-5-for-a-Blessed-Solo-Eid.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-517" src="http://my-iddah.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Tip-5-for-a-Blessed-Solo-Eid-300x300.jpg" alt="Tip #5 for a Blessed Solo 'Eid" width="300" height="300" /></a></h3>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<b>Umm Yusha</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> tells us, “</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Don&#8217;t be alone. .. invite other widows that are able to come out. Invite elderly and reverts&#8230;. anyone else that might be alone&#8230;It sounds too painful to spend any happy occasion alon</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">e.”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<b>Zeinab S</b><span style="font-weight: 400">. said she “<em>used to invite friends in similar circumstances as me (single mothers)- we used to share breakfast after Eid salah and afterward together we would take the kids out together. One need not be alone &#8211; one can create a family from those around us. Make friends with sisters in the same boat and create memories for your kids.”</em></span><br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Tip #6: Embrace the Solitude</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><a href="http://my-iddah.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Tip-6-for-a-Blessed-Solo-Eid.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-518" src="http://my-iddah.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Tip-6-for-a-Blessed-Solo-Eid-300x300.jpg" alt="Tip #6 for a Blessed Solo 'Eid" width="300" height="300" /></a></h3>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<b><i>“</i></b><i><span style="font-weight: 400">I found changing my mindset really helped&#8230; Instead of thinking of what I was missing, I focused on the blessings of being alone…”</span></i> <b>Kate from</b><span style="color: #993366"><b> </b><a style="color: #993366" href="https://www.facebook.com/healthymuslimah/" target="_blank"><b>Healthy Muslimah</b></a></span><span style="font-weight: 400"> says. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">“Instead of feeling lonely, I looked at the time alone as a beautiful tranquil time for self-reflection. While others were busy tending families…, I had the opportunity to sit quietly with Quran, to make dua, to eat a simple meal&#8230; I had time, I had a quiet and peaceful environment. Looking at the benefits and how I could use them to move closer to Allah made all the difference to me.”</span></i><br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Tip #7: Create New Traditions! Do something new and exciting!</h3>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<a href="http://my-iddah.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Tip-7-for-a-Blessed-Solo-Eid.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-520" src="http://my-iddah.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Tip-7-for-a-Blessed-Solo-Eid-300x300.jpg" alt="Tip #7 for a Blessed Solo 'Eid" width="300" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<b><i>“</i></b><i><span style="font-weight: 400">The majority of my eids have been alone, even now with my husband, also a revert, and&#8230; 3 children, we have to be inventive.”</span></i> <b>Amy H</b><span style="font-weight: 400">. tells us. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">“Trips to aquariums, interactive science center etc. have been great. The best eids I&#8217;ve had though were ones where we played with the children in the park, where we laughed and smiled. The other was where we took our canoe up the river in our local national park. We landed on a sand bar, had a picnic, just in the middle of Allah&#8217;s creation.”</span></i><br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Tip #8: Attend the &#8216;Eid Salat</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://my-iddah.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Tip-8-for-a-Blessed-Solo-Eid.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-519" src="http://my-iddah.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Tip-8-for-a-Blessed-Solo-Eid-300x300.jpg" alt="Tip #8 for a Blessed Solo 'Eid" width="300" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><i>“</i></b><i><span style="font-weight: 400">In the 4 1/2 years that I was divorced, I spent every single Eid on my own. My ex used to take the kids away with him and never allowed them to spend the Eid with me…”</span></i> <b>Ayesha L</b><span style="font-weight: 400">. tells us. “</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Until one day I decided enough was enough; I pushed myself out of the house and attended the Eid prayer. I stayed in the masjid a little while longer after the prayer just to give salam to my sisters. Alhamdulillah even if it was only for a hour or so I was in the company of my sisters.”</span></i><br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Tip #9: Be Grateful. Gratitude is the root of happiness.</h3>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<a href="http://my-iddah.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Tip-9-for-a-Blessed-Solo-Eid.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-521" src="http://my-iddah.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Tip-9-for-a-Blessed-Solo-Eid-300x300.jpg" alt="Tip #9 for a Blessed Solo 'Eid" width="300" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">I’m not sure if Eid with my 3 children can be considered being alone? Last year after Eid prayers we went to the cinema, followed by a nice meal out and desserts after. The next day I surprised my kids by driving up to Birmingham, we stayed in a hotel and visited Cadburys world. Ate out again and did some abaya shopping! We had an amazing time and more fun than many of my married friends!” </span></i><b>Umm Layla</b> <span style="font-weight: 400">says.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Aisha </b><span style="font-weight: 400">F. says “</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8230;Now I have 6 children. My husband is not here in the UK with us, so I normally spend the Eid day with my sons and daughters alhamdulillah. Here in Leicester, after Eid prayer, in the masjid, there are cakes and tea and sometimes a bouncy castle for kids. We spend a couple of hours in the masjid, then we come home. Sometimes I prepare food, sometimes we go to the restaurant, or to eat an Italian &#8216;gelato&#8217; (ice cream), alhamdulillah, for me to be with my children is not &#8216;to be alone.”</span></i><br />
&nbsp;<br />
So whether you&#8217;re spending this &#8216;Eid alone, with your kids, with family, friends, or even your new husband, enjoy it til the last drop!<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<h3>&#8216;Eid Mubarak from our hearts to yours!</h3>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Written By: Fatima Asmal</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The air humidifier I bought from a friend at<span style="color: #993366"> <a style="color: #993366" href="https://www.facebook.com/events/219166755151577/" target="_blank">Muslimah Today</a></span> this weekend is on. It makes a soothing sound as it whirls around eucalyptus-laced water and shines all sorts of colourful and soothing light into the room.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Beside me, Amr&#8211; who developed a nasty throat infection yesterday&#8211; has finally fallen into a deep sleep. Thankfully he isn&#8217;t battling to breathe as he was last night, thanks to a comprehensive prescription of medicine from our doctor, including the eucalyptus as well as a break from school.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>My life is nothing like I imagined it would be.</strong> Women with Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome don&#8217;t fall pregnant easily; I fell pregnant without even intending for it to happen, within three months of being married to his father. And here he is now, this precious, kind, sensitive, generous, warm, loving, funny being&#8230;eleven years old, about to turn twelve, in sha Allah.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Subhaanallah</em>. What a blessing! What a gift from Allah. He has certainly always been my ease with my difficulty; A wise and resilient child who is extremely forgiving. I love him so very much. <em>His pain&#8211; whether emotional or physical&#8211; is something I literally feel.</em> If he&#8217;s ill or distressed, my life comes to a stand-still. My <em>dua&#8217;as</em> these days, as he approaches maturity and hence Islamic accountability, have become increasingly about him.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I ask Allah to bless him with love for the Qur&#8217;an: its memorisation, its retention, a deep understanding thereof and its implementation in his life. And I ask Allah to give him the best of teachers in this regard; in that they are sincere, skilled and close to Allah.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I ask Allah to keep him away from immorality and keep his heart pure and free from spiritual diseases.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I ask Allah for academic success and sporting success yes, but I specifically request that Allah grants him the desire to always prioritise Allah above everything else.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I ask Allah to keep our relationship strong and strengthen it further, and to bless him with an Allah-loving life partner who will be a daughter to me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I do not know what the future holds for us both. I can only pray for brightness and contentment, and hold tight to him whilst I have him to myself, cherishing him and marveling at him. Picking him up from school is never a chore; It&#8217;s the highlight of my day.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In fact, <em>Amr has been the highlight of my life</em>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This weekend <span style="color: #993366"><a style="color: #993366" href="https://www.facebook.com/radia.bawahendricks?fref=ts" target="_blank">Ustaadhah Radia Bawa Hendricks</a></span> said that what you see when you look at your children is in essence who you are. I don&#8217;t have the greatest of self-esteem and am extremely hard on myself, but if Amr is indeed a reflection of me, then I am pleased with, and grateful for, that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There is a delicate tension in the state of iddah, the mourning period for a widow. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">On the one hand, life continues, particularly if you have children or have to work to support your family. The pressures, demands and responsibilities are real and they won&#8217;t wait for four months and ten days to be over. In this space, you are forced to plan, to look forward, to move on, to face the world. It can be an exquisite distraction from the pain that lies buried deep under the school run, bedtime stories and endless paperwork and deadlines. But it is still a distraction.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">On the other hand, your state of iddah restricts you; you cannot fully embrace life, even if you wanted to. You must pause. You must reflect. You must withdraw. You must face the reality, brave the darkness: the ache, the loneliness, the anger, the fear, the feeling of being bereft. You must face it because it will break you down, bring you to your knees, make you feel once again that vulnerability of his last days when you would have given anything for one last apology, one last kiss, one last promise. You must face the reality that this is Allah&#8217;s plan for you. And that, if this is so, there must be khair in it for you. It&#8217;s there. It&#8217;s there in the chance to ask for forgiveness, to pour your heart out, to cleanse, to rectify your soul, to purify your habits, to be ready to emerge from your iddah like a butterfly from a chrysalis: reborn, refashioned, beautiful.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For it is only through being tested that we realise our true selves.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The small kindnesses,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The tender mercies,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The moments of joy,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The flashes</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> of relief</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Don&#8217;t make up for the loss.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Not entirely.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But they help.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">They help to remind you</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That you have permission to smile,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">To feel joy</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And love</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If we open our arms</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">To embrace it.</span></p>
