				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><b>When True Love Comes Twice</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Zainab Bint Younus </b><span style="font-weight: 400">looks to the inspirations of the past and marvels at the many ways the heart can fall in love. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Many people are raised to believe that you live once, you die once and you only have one true love. A culture of fairy tales and happily ever afters, romcoms and romance novels has raised generations of people to believe that out there in the world is just </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">one</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> person who was meant to be with you &#8211; just </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">one</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> person </span><span style="font-weight: 400">with whom you will fall in love so deeply that you will never truly love anyone else besides them.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Umm Salamah (RA) proved this theory false. She had not just one love of her life, but </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">two</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> true loves! Umm Salamah was married to Abdullah ibn &#8216;Abdul-Asad &#8211; also known as Abu Salamah, the father of her child. Together, they were amongst the first of those who accepted Islam and made the first emigration to Abyssinia. Although they were separated on their second hijrah to Madinah, their love was strong and endured to see them reunited until Abu Salamah died of a battle wound. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Whilst on his deathbed, Umm Salamah tearfully told her husband, &#8220;if the husband of a woman dies and he is of the people of Paradise and his wife dies after him without having remarried, Allah will bring them back together in Jannah. Let us pledge that neither of us will remarry!&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Abu Salamah asked her, &#8220;Will you obey me in whatever I request of you?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Fervently, Umm Salamah replied, &#8220;Of course!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Abu Salamah gazed at her, his heart overflowing with love for her and told her, &#8220;If I die, swear to me that you will remarry!&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While Umm Salamah looked on in shock, he supplicated to Allah: &#8220;O Allah! Provide for Umm Salamah a man who is better than me!&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Umm Salamah spent her &#8216;iddah grieving for her deceased husband, her heart breaking every time she thought of his gentleness, his kindness, his courage and his patience. As she cradled her newborn daughter, she wept at the thought that Abu Salamah would never see his daughter and that there might be no man who would be willing to raise another man&#8217;s children as his own. She thought back often on his words and wondered, in anguish, &#8220;Who could be better than Abu Salamah?&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her question was answered almost immediately: when her &#8216;iddah ended at the birth of her daughter, Zaynab, Rasool Allah (SAW) asked for her hand in marriage. In disbelief, Umm Salamah sent him a response: &#8220;I am an older woman, I am a jealous woman and I have children from my previous husband.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With his characteristic tenderness, Rasool Allah (SAW) answered her fears: &#8220;I am older than you, Allah will remove jealousy from your heart and I will raise your children amongst my own.&#8221; </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The hesitation in Umm Salamah&#8217;s heart and the remnants of her grief for Abu Salamah faded away, replaced with a sense of calmness and peace. Abu Salamah&#8217;s du&#8217;a had been answered and, once again, Umm Salamah experienced the wonder and beauty of true love&#8230; for the second time.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There are many men and women who fall in love and are devastated at its loss, whether that loss occurs through death, divorce or simply tests and trials in life that one never anticipated. The grief that one experiences can feel overwhelming and unbearable and often one wonders if they will ever be able to experience such love again. Yet, though our own concept and understanding of love is limited, Allah, al-Wadud, is not. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Messenger of Allah (SAW) said: </span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">“Verily, the hearts of the children of Adam, all of them, are between the two fingers of the Most Merciful as one heart; He directs them wherever he wills.” </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">(Sahih Muslim 2654)</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The One who placed love in our hearts for one person is easily able to heal our broken hearts and grant us the deep joy and comfort of another love in our lives – someone whom we will love not as a replacement for the person we have lost before, but as someone who will have captured our hearts in their own unique way. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">On the other hand, there is the unique situation of polygamy. It is a difficult thing for many women to understand and accept and it’s true that polygamy amongst Muslims has garnered a bad reputation with a lot of negative baggage. Even so, it is something that should be recognised – although there are many Muslim men who have done polygamy badly, there are those who have done it well and with justice. Allah (SWT) has also blessed these men with true love, not once, but twice or even several more times. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Abu Bakr (RA) is well known for being married to two great women: Umm Rumaan, the mother of A’ishah (RA) and Asmaa’ bint ‘Umays. Although he divorced his first wife, Qutaylah, who did not accept Islam, Abu Bakr cared for Umm Rumaan and Asmaa’ dearly. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When Umm Rumaan died, Rasool Allah (SAW) prayed Salat ul-Janazah over her body and lowered her into her grave saying, “Whoever wishes to see a woman from amongst the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">hoor </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">of Paradise, let him look upon Umm Rumaan!” As for Asmaa’ bint ‘Umays, Abu Bakr specifically asked that she be the one to wash his body when he died. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For men and women alike, Allah’s mercy for His creation is such that He enables our hearts to be capable of so many different types of love; He has given us the ability to love, to lose and to love again. Indeed, it is through this very blessing of His, the gift of being able to love repeatedly and in so many ways, that our hearts grow closer to Him in </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">taqwa</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> &#8211; a love born of hope and awe. Truly, who is more deserving of our love than Al-Wadud?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>{And of His signs is that He created for you from yourselves mates that you may find tranquillity in them and He placed between you love and mercy. Indeed in that are signs for a people who give thought.}</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> (</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Ar-Room:21)</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Written by: Leah D. Hanoosh</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"><strong>Sometimes love is not enough</strong>. Repeat that to yourself. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Some reading this may do so, wondering why I state the obvious. Others, especially those of us who are converts and/or have been brought up surrounded by the typically “Western” narrative of marriage, may repeat the words with a touch of hesitation. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Love is not enough. <em>Love is</em><em> not enough?  </em></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Don’t misunderstand: love brings light, harmony, joy, and adventure to a relationship. Love is a wonderful and important element in a marriage. <em>But it is not enough</em>. It is not the foundation upon which marriage must be based. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What, then, is that foundation? Once you answer that question for yourself, you will be equipped to begin preparing for a new, healthy marriage.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We crave love. Having survived divorce, completed your iddah, and now arrived at the point where you are hoping to remarry, it is normal that you should desire a warm and loving relationship. However, if I were allowed only one piece of advice to give to those preparing for a new marriage, it would be this: </span><strong>treat any match like a business transaction before you allow emotions to enter the equation.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Make a list. What personal qualities are you looking for? What are the prerequisites for any candidate before consideration? What essential elements must your relationship hold? Which points are non-negotiable? Where may you be open to compromise? Ask any potential match to create a similar list. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If this approach seems somewhat cold and methodical, that is a good thing. In the beginning, imagine you are interviewing candidates for a job, rather than searching for your life partner. Though this may be a difficult mindset to adopt, for some, it is ultimately for your own benefit. If you discover that a possible future husband is incompatible, or he holds some sort of belief or characteristic that is a deal breaker, it will be much easier to say no if you aren’t in love. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Once in love, we tend to make excuses, to hope for change in our partner, to convince ourselves that it will be okay – even if it won’t. It can be painful to break things off. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In every Disney love story, the movie ends with a wedding. But in Islam, <em>the wedding is the beginning. </em></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Everything we do before we marry must be in an attempt to create a foundation upon which we can live the rest of our lives. But how do we do that? What do we look for? Though I have advised thus far that love is not enough and that you should create lists, I have given few specifics. I have taken this approach because the journey to a new marriage is highly individual. What I looked for in a husband may be vastly different from anyone else. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We all hold different values and we all have different priorities. Some of us may hold religiosity to the highest standard of importance. Some may have an adamant desire for more children (or any children at all), while others are willing to compromise on that point. However, no matter your personal deal breakers, no matter your list of priorities, every marriage must have within its foundation the elements of <strong>respect</strong> and <strong>trust</strong>. It is <em>impossible</em> to have a healthy marriage without these things. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After you have made your lists and found someone compatible, work on establishing respect, work on building trust. A marriage where there is a lack of respect on one or both sides is a toxic one. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The above is more or less the model my husband and I followed as we were getting to know one another before we definitively decided that we wanted to marry. We exchanged emails, spent many hours on the phone, discussing our personal beliefs and priorities in detail. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We did not – do not – correspond identically, nor do any two people, I am sure. But we decided very early on to be methodical in our approach to marriage. It worked well for us. We connected first on a rational level, our personalities clicked, and a relationship of love grew from there, and continues to grow. I believe that as long as all parties are exercising honesty, it should work well for any couple. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It is vital to remember, however, that no matter how compatible you seem with your husband-to-be, there will be bumps in the road. <strong>No marriage, even those between the closest of friends and the greatest of soulmates, is without its difficulties.</strong> This is, perhaps, the second most important piece of advice, and one that my grandma gave me on more than one occasion: </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">marriage can be hard</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">. It can be especially difficult to bear that in mind as we search for our true love, our real happily ever after. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After divorce, we thirst even more for a relationship filled with the simplicity of comfort and love. But with the right partner, bumps in the road are steps towards that place of comfort. It is as Allah told us in the Quran: “Verily, after hardship comes ease.” </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In Surat ar-Rum, Allah said: </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">“And among His signs is this, that He created for you mates from among yourselves, that you may dwell in tranquility with them, that He has put love and mercy between you…”</span></i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Love may not be a good building block upon which to begin a marriage, but with a good foundation – trust and respect – and strong supporting pillars – compatibility of priorities, beliefs, and personality – love is something that will naturally bloom. </span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Written By: Nina</h3>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
A few months had rolled by as I was trying to pick up the pieces after leaving my marital home. My best friend announced she was getting married and I was filled with joy for the girl-now-turned-woman who had been my companion since childhood.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<span style="font-weight: 400">I sat among the guests at her wedding, watching her shine in all her bridal glory. </span><br />
&nbsp;<br />
<span style="font-weight: 400">As I sat, I was overcome by a huge heavy lump in my heart while tears burned my eyes. My mind had drifted back to my own wedding. Flashbacks of the henna that had adorned my arms the night before, making me shiver with cold, the beautiful heavy red and cream embroidered dress, family rejoicing with laughter and typical wedding squabbles ….and plans.</span><br />
&nbsp;<br />
<i><span style="font-weight: 400">Plans</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">!</span><br />
&nbsp;<br />
<span style="font-weight: 400">I had planned to marry, to move, to pave a new way and find a new haven. I had held visions of a future, family, travel, old age. Side by side, hand-in-hand.</span><br />
&nbsp;<br />
<span style="font-weight: 400">As I sat quietly gulping down the incredibly painful sobbing, I realised I had lost it all. <strong>I had lost my future.</strong> I knew it was all gone. How did I end up here with nothing but a black shadow in front of me?</span><br />
&nbsp;<br />
<span style="font-weight: 400">I couldn’t understand my emotions at the time. I was elated for my friend, I did not miss my ex or what we had. Ironically, I missed my </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">future</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> – the future I had envisioned, my hopes and dreams gone.</span><br />
&nbsp;<br />
<span style="font-weight: 400">During the same time period, my friend Saima stumbled upon something she hadn’t known about her husband, leaving her broken and soon-to-be-divorced. She felt lost, confused and alone as she moved back into her parents’ home to begin again. She came from a culture where family and tradition were tightly knit, where everyone knew and had a say in the latest that happened. There was no escaping this; Her world had ended.</span><br />
&nbsp;<br />
<span style="font-weight: 400">Soon after, I met a lady who was to become a lovely friend. Jasmeen had recently lost her husband to cancer. A young couple very much in love, best friends to each other; She took care of him and held him to the last. I met her, a softly-spoken young woman who was living with her grief every day. She would tell stories of their bond, of his obvious adoration of her and her deep love and affection for him. </span><br />
&nbsp;<br />
<span style="font-weight: 400">I would feel my heart hurt when she would tell me how she was trying to hold on to him, how she would hold his clothes close to her, to breathe in his scent, and somehow keep him alive in her head.  Her future had a full stop punctuating it and there was no going back. Or forward.</span><br />
&nbsp;<br />
<span style="font-weight: 400">Back then, in the wake of my divorce I remember feeling a hatred and distrust of men, feeling sure I could never trust again. After some time had passed, though, I began to see with clarity that I was wrong to paint everyone with the same brush. Gradually, my mind began pulling me along with its own force.</span><br />
&nbsp;<br />
<span style="font-weight: 400">I would feel a pang of sadness as I turned the key to my door knowing the house would be dark, cold and devoid of life.</span><br />
&nbsp;<br />
<span style="font-weight: 400">How many nights I would sigh as I sat downstairs yearning to hear the noise of someone pittering around the house,  I missed the touches only a man could bring; fixing something, watching football, trying to fix a sandwich in the kitchen and making a mess.</span><br />
&nbsp;<br />
<span style="font-weight: 400">How many times did my child do or say something funny or interesting and I would have to supress the urge to turn and say “<em>did you just hear what he said</em>?!”</span><br />
&nbsp;<br />
<span style="font-weight: 400">I missed feeling protected by strong shoulders only a man can provide particularly when out-and-about alone.</span><br />
&nbsp;<br />
<span style="font-weight: 400">I desperately missed not being able to share my thoughts and deen with someone especially at a time I was discovering Islam myself. I needed the support to learn, grow, and implement.</span><br />
&nbsp;<br />
<span style="font-weight: 400">I found myself missing a companion terribly. <strong>As wonderful as my friends and family were, there was no substitute for what a man could bring.</strong> I am not ashamed to admit my solitude was suffocating me.</span><br />
&nbsp;<br />
<span style="font-weight: 400">Fast forward a collective 3-4 years between us.  Saima re-married, as did I, as did Jasmeen. None of us envisaged this could possibly happen at the time of our trials and individual grief. </span><span style="font-weight: 400">At one time we were each locked in our own realms of loss, we were bleeding inwardly and there was no chance of anything changing. <strong>Except it did</strong>.</span><br />
&nbsp;<br />
<span style="font-weight: 400">Amidst death, messy divorces, moves, court dates, child-custody battles, bitter emotions and a complete life overhaul, we each made it slowly through to a new frame of mind. <strong>None of us had lost our future. In the midst of pain and anguish we were only fooled into thinking we had.</strong></span><br />
&nbsp;<br />
<span style="font-weight: 400">Somehow the rawness began healing, our hearts began mending, time turned into acceptance. </span><br />
&nbsp;<br />
<span style="font-weight: 400">Each of us healed in our own ways, in our own times. Our stories were different, our journeys separate, our scars unlike each other’s, like personalised tattoos embellished inside of us.</span><br />
&nbsp;<br />
<span style="font-weight: 400">But we arrived at the same destination. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Daring to hope</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> &#8211; ready to start again.</span><br />
&nbsp;<br />
<span style="font-weight: 400">Life has to go on. Whether that means gathering up the courage to carry on as you were, re-marriage, a move, a new career and so on. There is no shame in needing a companion again, in feeling desire, wanting to make a fresh start and being part of a partnership again. </span><br />
&nbsp;<br />
<span style="font-weight: 400">Hope is a frightening yet exhilarating ride if you dare to get on. It opens doors which will inspire you to dream, to pray and to actualise your needs. Do not lose hope and don’t put limits on what Allah can do for you. Call upon Al –Fattah (The Opener) to open doors of goodness for you. Allah will make a way where you have not imagined, if you ask of Him &#8211; if you trust Him.  </span><br />
&nbsp;<br />
<span style="font-weight: 400"><em>&#8220;And whoever fears Allah &#8211; He will make for him a way out. And will provide for him from where he does not expect. And whoever relies upon Allah &#8211; then He is sufficient for him.&#8221; </em>(</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Surah At-Talaq 2-3)</span><br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Written By: Misbah Akhtar</h3>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
When looking for a potential spouse, there is much to consider- especially if you are a single mum.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
But one thing I never thought I would have to think about was asking a man if he could think as a step-father rather than as an individual. Call me naïve, but I automatically assumed that he would have thought about the sacrifices he would have to make as a step-father and also would have carefully thought things through before committing to marriage with a single mother.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
It seems most men are somewhat clueless as to the degree of responsibility they face if they choose to marry a single mum. They go to such intimate lengths to do their research on a car, check it out, make sure it&#8217;s worthy enough to own and they don’t judge it on appearance alone. I dare say I had hoped men would apply the same formula for marriage.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
On the contrary, most see someone they like and try to squash them into a Stepford Wife mould. They want their wife to wrap her and her children’s lives around them instead of doing it the other way around. Is this fair? Is this what we have to expect now as single mums?<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Granted, he won&#8217;t know everything, but if a sister tells a guy she doesn’t have anyone to leave her children with, why do they hold it against her when she says she can’t dump her kids somewhere to go on a honeymoon? Some men think that they can still lead the same lives they had before. You can’t just have alone time or be intimate whenever you want during the day if you have kids, and you can’t expect to swan off for dinner alone whenever you want if you have no babysitter!<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Some honestly think being a step-dad only means financially providing for the kids and taking them to the Masjid. What about being a role model and showing kids by example how to behave? What about giving up those bad habits and watching what you say? What about playing with them and doing ‘dad stuff’? What about remembering that the kids had a life before you and a routine and that if anything it&#8217;s YOU coming into THEIR family and therefore it’s YOU who has to adjust?<br />
&nbsp;<br />
It’s hard for children to adjust to a new dad, especially if they still maintain ties with their old one. How are YOU going to tackle that? Why should it be the woman’s responsibility to fix everything just because the kids are hers? Kids don’t understand that they won&#8217;t be loved straight away; If they are craving a father figure they may latch onto the guy immediately. They won&#8217;t know that their step-dad needs time. YOU need to be sensitive to these things.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
A few home truths for the brothers out there:</p>
<ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Single mums are pickier than single women, as well they should be.</strong></li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>We may have ‘baggage’ but we also have experience, wisdom, and maturity that not many single women will have.</strong></li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>We understand sacrifice better than any other single woman.</strong></li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>We may be ‘second-hand’ but if we had to choose between a man and our kids, our kids would ALWAYS come first.</strong></li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>We may want marriage, but NOT at the expense of making our children&#8217;s lives worse.</strong></li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Don’t mention how we need to strengthen our faith, because it is faith alone that has got us as far as we have come!</strong></li>
</ul>
</ul>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Written by: Anisah Jameel-Hardy</h3>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>With most things in my life a ruin, I was left to contemplate the many reasons why I’d failed</strong>; I was in debt, had an unfaithful husband and a life with very little time to spend with my children. I couldn’t think of any bigger topics in life to be ruined such as these three things: marriage, finance and children. My soon-to-be ex-husband, now living in our spare room, was still battling for our reconciliation; however, after his constant unchaste behaviour, I realised it was a losing battle and divorce was imminent.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
One rainy evening, I was staring out of my back stable door as I often did. With the rain dripping heavily off the trees into my garden and the wind lightly swaying the leaves, I reverted my eyes towards the skies. I remember thinking as I gazed at the clouds and the stars, “No debt collector, husband, or anyone for that matter could take those away”. As I said these words to myself, I pondered on their meaning; at least no one has the power to take the beautiful vision of nature I had from my stable door. That lead me to realise that all these years of hoping that there was a God, now I felt that God was proving to me He was there by showing me His universal power.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
I then found myself pleading with the Lord above me for the next half hour, “You are there, aren’t you?… Please God, guide me now… I beg of you to guide me now… I know I’m not here for this.” Then, I sobbed and wept and wiped my tears and closed the stable door.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
The next morning, my soon-to-be ex-husband informed me that he desperately needed a motorbike for work. My entire body suddenly went hot and cold like a fever; I’m going to get into even more debt. I took a deep breath and informed him, “I won’t be a party to you borrowing more money. Leave my name out of it.” There was a small debate, later an argument, until eventually, he told me he was going to borrow this money anyway.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Two mornings later, he presented me with paperwork to sign. In signing these papers, I would sign all debt over to him – over twenty grand’s worth. This was the only way this loan company would lend him the money; they would handle all his debt. I could hardly believe it. This would mean, apart from the mortgage, I would be completely debt-free – something I had prayed for for years. I signed the papers, handed them back and waited a few days to get the confirmation paperwork. The paperwork arrived, and my name wasn’t anywhere to be seen on the debt papers. Allahu Akbar.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Three days later, I decided to do something I felt I needed to do at the time: be athletic. So I signed up for a Jujutsu class. It was in this class I met a Muslim brother fasting for Ramadhan. “Oh yeah!” I exclaimed, “Wait, what’s that?”. He told me it was an Islamic obligation. “And where is Islam?”, I ignorantly asked. Once his chuckles subsided, he explained things to me, only leading to more questions, and then more questions. From there, he informed me that he was just learning about it himself.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
The following week, I looked forward to going to Jujutsu, as I had a page of questions for that brother. As he realised how interested I was, the following week, he brought me a book called Islam: The Natural Way. The next week, we exchanged numbers and I couldn’t wait to see him again, because another page of questions was fast developing.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
During my journey of knowledge, we were obviously growing attached to each other. Our relationship grew and a year later came to what I’d describe as a sad but inevitable end. We had recently discovered the rulings around fornication, and the punishments associated with this act almost made me burn inside from fear. I asked the brother to find someone who could help me say my shahadah, which was done in 24 hours. <strong>I was now officially a Muslim.</strong><br />
&nbsp;<br />
Me and the brother then decided not to see each other again, as I was now abiding by the same rules as he. As I did everything overnight, including the full hijab and abayah, this was now a very lonely time for me. People at work had no understanding at all about what I was doing, my two sisters thought I had gone mad, and with losing my mother when I was just 19, I had nobody to turn to. As far as the relationship with the brother was concerned, although I was saddened at not seeing him, my worst loss was that there were no more installments in the Islamic knowledge he had been passing on to me. The sisters I had taken shahadah with, I felt, were so politically motivated, and I expressed my concern that I still hadn’t been taught to pray, and didn’t they feel this was the most important thing to teach me? One of them agreed and then began to help me learn to pray, Alhamdulillah.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
The weeks passed, and in those weeks the brother would drop off a huge bag of halal meat at my back door and leave – all I managed to see was a glimpse of his head as he walked away.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
One day, I received a text from the brother – I was so excited, I couldn’t contain myself. The message read: “Would you like to be my wife?” Needless to say, my response was a “yes”. It had bothered and unnerved me how I, a western woman with two children, with no family and no Muslim connections was going to find a decent, practising Muslim husband. How could I marry someone I didn’t even know? I turned to my Lord who had rescued me from my previous life, and asked Him to please open a way for this brother and I to marry, if he was indeed a good, practising Muslim that will treat me well. If not, I honestly would not have wanted to marry him, despite my fondness for him.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
The next four weeks were tougher than the past two. The brother’s family ideally wanted a Pakistani bride for their son. However, they agreed to visit me – and I was extremely nervous as I hadn’t seen enough of the brother to discuss the meeting with him. They were a very traditional family, but, remarkably, they agreed, provided the wedding was a small affair. The father was interested in why I had become Muslim; <em>had I become Muslim simply to marry his son? </em>It wasn’t long for him to establish that his son was not the reason I had accepted Islam. I was very grateful to this family, as I had heard many traditional families had very sad stories to tell. They overcame their traditions and followed the sunnah.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
The brother then informed me that once we were married, it would be better for me to either leave my permanent office job or become part-time in preparation to leave. He asked me how I would feel about that. This would enable me to be a full-time mother to my children, which again was something I had prayed for for years. I then realised, bit by bit, the troubles and traumas from my past non-Muslim life were remarkably being taken care of, and we know by Whom, don’t we?<br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Written By: Umm Haani</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Prophet Muhammad (SAW) used to often supplicate with the words:</p>
<blockquote><p>“<em>Yaa Muqqallabal Quloob, Thabith Qalbi ala Deenik</em>”<br />
“O Controller of hearts, keep my heart steadfast on your religion”.</p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Five years ago, when I was going through a most heart-breaking divorce, I could never have fathomed bliss</strong>. Today, the condition of my heart surprises me to no end. Strangely, I find myself framing questions to the answers that are now dwelling inside me. I wonder what happened to the passion I once felt for my former spouse. What transpired with the sensual desires that had frozen over? What happened to the tender emotions that had turned to Sahara? What loosened the tangled mass of anger and guilt? What lightened the weight of self-pity and remorse? What happened to the high walls I had built around my heart? What became of my resolve to never place myself in a position of vulnerability again?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Revolutions don’t take place overnight – in nations or in hearts. They begin with small sporadic incidents of friction and rebellion, then slowly gain strength and resolve as they unify and inch towards recognition, &#8217;till finally they burst forth, seize control and rein supreme.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This quiet revolution began with the first mention of this ‘suitable person’ who I should meet ‘at least once’. Naturally, my heart resisted. But meet I did, to appease the family. As I sat through that meeting over tea, my mind wandered everywhere but to the ‘suitable person’ in front of me. It ended with a sigh and a flat refusal from my side. I got busy with my life again. Then one day, I was told that he would be coming round again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This stopped me in my tracks. Apparently, the ‘suitable person’ was a follower of his gut feeling, a gut feeling that was contrary to mine! While my heart fumed over such audacious hope and was seized with anxiety, it also registered a subtle flutter. But I promptly dismissed it. The rebellious forces of past feelings tried to fight and subdue the stirring. This time, my mind stayed focused – with the intent to seize any point that will prove him ‘unsuitable’. I didn’t succeed. Not only did he not give me anything to use against him, but, on the contrary, he said all the right things!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The next couple of weeks were spent in turmoil and reflection – a full-fledged civil war. The mind had surrendered; my heart continued a fierce struggle. Naturally, I sided with the latter. The mind beseeched with logic: right man, right goals, right manners, new hope. My heart appealed with emotions: reminders of pain, mistrust, broken promises, vulnerability… This battle continued for a long time until I reached the point where I decided to resign myself to my fate and submit completely to Allah (SWT)’s Will.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Did my mind win over my heart? No. But I convinced my heart to sit back and see where we would go. Like the fervent invocation of a blind person lost in the desert, I begged Allah (SWT) to decree <em>khair</em> for me – wherever it was. I repeatedly prayed Istikhara for guidance. A major portion of these supplications centered on the state of my heart. “O Controller of hearts, make my heart accept him if he is good for me. O Allah, soften my heart towards him….”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I consulted a sister for advice about my dilemma. She told me something that really helped. She said that sometimes we spend our entire lives standing on the sidelines, afraid to scale new heights for fear of falling, yet, only when we push aside those fears and reach the steep edge, do we realise we can fly. <em>“I am pushing you, </em>habibi,<em> because I know you too can fly,”</em> she said.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I asked my parents to decide on my behalf and in two months I was married. <strong>No, I didn’t fall in love with him the next day</strong>. It helped that he didn’t harbour such expectations from me. And it certainly helped that he showered me with all the love he possessed. Day after day and little by little, I became aware of the reawakening of my heart – to an emotion that I had given up on. A revolution took place – one where the heart did not surrender, but was won over.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yesterday while holding me, he remarked, “Isn’t the state of our relationship an amazing sign of Allah (SWT)!” I smiled, holding back my tears. Indeed it is. <strong>For it is through Him (SWT) that I have learned to love again, trust again, hope again and to start again.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Umm Haani is grateful to Allah for her new beginning. She encourages remarriage to all those sisters who have given up on their hearts.</h4>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Written by: Kaighla Um Dayo</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Among some of the harsher things I heard when I divorced my husband came from one of my best friends. </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One day, out of the blue, she messaged me on Facebook&#8211; which is, by the way, the <em>least</em> <em>appropriate</em> place for a conversation like this&#8211; and told me she didn&#8217;t want my friendship anymore because I was &#8220;willing to give up my children for the chance to be married again&#8221;.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Not only was this untrue, but it was extremely hurtful and insensitive coming from someone I believed to be my best friend. She then blocked me on all social media and disappeared from my life forever.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Why did she assume that remarrying would inherently require that I give up my children? And why did she assume that if such a choice was placed before me, I&#8217;d choose a man over my children?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve all heard this same reproach offered to us. Ironically, it&#8217;s the women with men in their lives who say these things. Sure, they may not be married yet or again, but they definitely have a father, or a brother, or an uncle, or the husband of a friend looking out for their well-being.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For a convert, that responsibility most often falls into the hands of a husband, as most of us do not have fathers or brothers who are both willing and able to do the work. For many of us, we lose the support of our family members the day we choose to embrace Islam, if not before.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4></h4>
<h4>&#8220;Focus on Yourself &amp; Your Kids&#8221;</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is another of the many tropes we divorceés and widows are subjected to. There is this fallacy that a man, by default, will be in as much need of one&#8217;s attention and care as a child is and that somehow marrying a man will take your focus off of your children.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sure, if you marry a man-baby who cannot pick up after himself or cook some eggs or care for you when you&#8217;re sick or watch the kids for you sometimes, your life will be harder. The solution here, though, is in choosing a <em>responsible</em> <em>man</em> to marry, not in refusing to marry anyone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Along this same line of argument is the idea that somehow being married takes away from the well-being of a woman. These women argue that rather than seeking a husband, a woman should sit on her hands and wait for God to drop the right man into her lap, or even just take away her need for a husband altogether. They argue that a woman who <em>needs</em> a husband is somehow <em>faulty</em>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The reality, however we like to paint things, is that Allah designed men and women to be interdependent: we need one another in very real ways. And the truth of the matter is that God gave women <em>qawwam</em> for a reason. Men, collectively, have the real responsibility to look out for the safety and well-being of the women in their care.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Islam is Realistic</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regardless the argument offered, the core problem remains: these people are not looking at life realistically.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Above all, Islam is realistic. It does not prevent eating; it suggests self-control in portion control and choices. Islam does not prohibit fun and leisure; it suggests balance in sleep and work, prayer and relaxation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And Islam does not encourage abstinence from sexual pleasure or emotional comfort from the opposite sex. Islam recognizes that human beings have a very real need for emotional and physical intimacy with members of the opposite sex. One need only look at the appalling situation among the professed-abstinent among the religious leaders of many religions and see the ill-effects of this type of obsession with refusing to fulfill this need with consenting adults: sexual deviance of the worst sort.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Single mothers are <em>women</em> and they are <em>human. </em>Faulting them for desiring and seeking a <em>halal</em> means to fulfill their emotional and physical needs of intimacy is directly out of line with the teachings of Islam.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Why is it that no one is pushing divorced and widower brothers into a corner and telling them to avoid remarriage? Who told them that women somehow have less of a need for this type of intimacy than men do?<em> Culture</em>, that&#8217;s who.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><em>Iddah </em>is Built-In Healing Time</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Telling a woman, especially a woman with children, that there is something noble or brave about refusing to remarry just on principle is unfair and unwise. Before telling a divorced or widowed woman to focus on herself, wait for God to bring the right man, focus on healing, etc, consider the following:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>God built a healing time into Islam, and it&#8217;s called <em>Iddah. </em>We do not have the right, nor the wisdom, to force a woman to wait longer than the prescribed time that God allotted her before choosing to remarry. That means a widow has every right to consider suitors and marry one as long as <i>4 months and 10 days</i> have passed. A divorceeé by <em>talaaq</em> has to wait three menstrual periods, and a divorceé by khul only has to wait <em>one menstrual cycle.</em>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Check Yourself</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Moreover, before telling a woman she should not need a man, consider how many men you rely on on a regular basis. Do you have a father? A brother? A neighbor who mows the lawn? Do you have a reliable taxi driver you call? Do you have a male friend you ask to walk you home at night if it&#8217;s dark? Any cousins who are male who help changing the tire when you have a flat?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Until and unless you have taken <em>every male</em> out of your life and stopped ever, <em>ever</em>, relying on them in any capacity, it is unfair and hypocritical to place that expectation on a woman who just needs the same support of a male in a <em>halal</em> fashion.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Be Careful How You Advise</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It was this sort of thinking that prohibited my ex-husband&#8217;s mother from re-marrying when her husband died in her early twenties. She had four small children and no male family members to help look after her. Within a decade, most of the land her husband had left for her and her children was taken by his family members and the men in the village. Because she was deluded into thinking remarriage would somehow dishonor her dead husband, her son became the sole guardian of his sisters and mother, as well as his father&#8217;s inheritance, at the tender age of 13.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This sort of responsibility created in him a savior-complex and to this day, there are ten children, countless women and their families, and our new spouses who are suffering because of his narcissism&#8211; all because he was given the power and authority over his family too early in life. Had she married a good man of good standing&#8211; any one of the many suitors who courted her&#8211;, perhaps he could have developed normally as a young man and so much could have been saved.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Islam is perfectly balanced when applied according to the laws in the <em>Qur&#8217;an</em> and <em>Sunnah</em> of our Prophet Muhammad (saws). Rather than imposing unrealitic expectations on our sisters, why not help them? Why not support them in healing during their <em>iddah</em> period wherein they really should focus <em>primarily</em> on themselves and their children. And then <em>suggest good men!</em> So many sisters avoid remarriage purely because they are terrified of experiencing the same pain or worse than that they experienced in their first marriage. Let us offer them the support they need in whatever part of their life we happen to have the honor to be part of rather than imposing our man-made, idealistic rules onto them.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><b>Umm ‘Umar </b><span style="font-weight: 400">discusses the issue of widows remarrying in the light of Islam and her own experiences.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I am a widow. My husband died a little over a year ago. He was a loving, caring and gentle man and the perfect companion, so it is nigh on impossible for me to conceive of ever being married to anyone else.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As a Muslim, I know that I have been accorded Divine Guidance in every single aspect of my life; I do not</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400"> have</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> to rely solely on my own, sometimes somewhat wobbly, whims and emotions. So what does Islam say on the subject of widows remarrying?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When a Muslim woman loses a spouse, Allah (SWT) has, in His Infinite Mercy and Wisdom, ordained for her an extended mourning period, known as her ‘iddah’, or ‘waiting period’.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">  “If any of you die and leave widows behind they shall wait concerning themselves four months and ten days: when they have fulfilled their term there is no blame on you if they dispose of themselves in a just and reasonable manner. And Allah is well acquainted with what ye do.” (Al-Baqarah:234)</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I refer to this prescribed waiting period as a mercy because I personally found it so. In Islam, the usual mourning period for the loss of a loved one other than a spouse is three days. To be expected to get over the death of one’s husband in such a short space of time, Allah (SWT) in all His Wisdom knows, is not possible! My husband was someone I relied on heavily. I realise it is a cliché, but he </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">was</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> a rock, a cornerstone in my life. We were, after all, as close as garments to one another. When he died, the fact that I was not expected to move on straight away &#8211; that I was allowed, nay expected and encouraged, to take a considerable length of time to grieve openly and fully &#8211; took an enormous pressure off me, Alhamdulillah.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My friends have become bold lately, as my all-consuming grief diminishes somewhat. They quip that it’s time I thought about remarrying, that I’m still young and ought not to be struggling alone with the children. They are right, in a way. It’s certainly not easy being on my own, and my three angst-ridden teenagers and zippy four-year-old pose many and varied challenges on a daily basis. Yet this to me seems a prime reason </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">not </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">to remarry. Although it would be wonderful to have someone alongside me to share the load, to shoulder some of the responsibility and the decision-making that I find so very hard at times, would this really be fair to the children? It would depend on the character and intentions of the brother of course, and I may well be blessed with a man who wanted to act as a loving father to my children, as well as a supportive husband to me; but making a wrong choice is far too risky in my mind, in terms of the upbringing and well-being of the children. It is mentioned in Bukhari’s book of manners that:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8216;Awf ibn Malik reported that the Prophet, may Allah Bless him and Grant him peace, said, &#8220;I and a woman who is widowed and is patient with her child will be like these two fingers in the Garden.&#8221; (Bukhari)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So, it seems that there is a virtue and a great reward in concentrating on nurturing and fulfilling the rights of one’s children, who are after all considered orphans after the death of their father.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yet we are not all brave and strong enough to endure all of life’s trials alone. Nor does Allah (SWT) expect us to. We were created in pairs alongside all of Allah’s Creation and so it is not natural for us to persevere alone, especially if we are reverts, or sisters with little or no family support. So re-marriage is a perfectly viable and understandable choice to make.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, like Umm Salamah (RA), I overwhelmingly feel that my late husband is simply irreplaceable. I can relate to her story in this regard, particularly her reluctance to recite the last six words of the du’a she was encouraged to say after her beloved Abu Salamah (RA) died:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">‘To Allah we belong, to Allah is our return. O Allah recompense me for my affliction and replace it with something better.’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">On completing her iddah, first Abu Bakr (RA) and then ‘Umar (RA) proposed to Umm Salamah (RA), yet she declined. When the Prophet (SAW) approached her for marriage she replied:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">‘O Messenger of Allah, I have three characteristics. I am a woman who is extremely jealous, and I am afraid that you will see in me something that will anger you and cause Allah to   punish me. I am a woman who is already advanced in age, and I am a woman who has a young family.’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Prophet (SAW) replied:</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">Regarding the jealousy you mentioned, I pray to Allah the Almighty to let it go away from you. Regarding the question of age you have mentioned, I am afflicted with the same problem as you. Regarding the dependent family you have mentioned, your family is my family.’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This beautiful conversation highlights some of the present day dilemmas widowed sisters may face: quandaries surrounding remarriage if one still has small children and issues of confidence and the reluctance to share one’s life with another man &#8211; one who may not be able to live up to the good character of one’s late husband.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Umm Salamah’s story helps us widowed sisters to understand and to have hope in the fact that Allah (SWT) can replace something that we hold so dear with something even better if we ask and expect Him to.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My husband actually encouraged me towards remarriage many times during his illness, giving me his ‘blessing’ as it were, so I would not shoulder any guilt as some widows may when considering this step. A pressing question for me is, assuming I </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">did </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">remarry, who then would be my husband in Jannah, insha Allah?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Al-Albaani authenticated a hadith, which states that our Prophet (SAW) said:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The woman will be for her last husband in Paradise.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Knowing this would heavily influence any remarrying decisions for me as I often ponder on the hope, and pray for the day that my late husband and I will be reunited insha Allah.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Imaam &#8216;Abdul-&#8216; Aziz bin &#8216;Abdillah bin Baz has mentioned other hadiths, in which the chains of narration are weak and debated, that state that if a woman was married more than once, she may choose the husband with the best character in Jannah. However, Imaam &#8216;Abdul-&#8216; Aziz bin &#8216;Abdillah bin Baz states that it is of course ultimately up to Allah SWT to determine this issue. He (SWT) knows best what will happen on the Day of Judgement and in the life hereafter.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Many myths and misconceptions surround the question of whether or not widows are allowed to remarry. The aforementioned quote from Surat Al-Baqarah (2:234) dispels those myths in one fell swoop, as does the fact that we know that our Prophet’s (SAW) first wife Khadija (RA) was a widow when she proposed to him (SAW). So not only is it definitely permissible in Islam for a widowed woman to remarry, but she may take the initiative and actually be the one to propose!</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We can see then, from an Islamic perspective, that should a widow one day choose to remarry, there is nothing wrong with fulfilling that need, and we are well within our rights to do so. Yet if we are able to cope alone and choose not to remarry, there is great virtue and reward in that.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As in all situations and dilemmas we face in life, Islam serves only to make things easier for us, giving us choices and catering for our individual circumstances and needs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alhamdulillah.</span></p>
