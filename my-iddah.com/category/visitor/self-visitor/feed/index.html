				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><b>When True Love Comes Twice</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Zainab Bint Younus </b><span style="font-weight: 400">looks to the inspirations of the past and marvels at the many ways the heart can fall in love. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Many people are raised to believe that you live once, you die once and you only have one true love. A culture of fairy tales and happily ever afters, romcoms and romance novels has raised generations of people to believe that out there in the world is just </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">one</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> person who was meant to be with you &#8211; just </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">one</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> person </span><span style="font-weight: 400">with whom you will fall in love so deeply that you will never truly love anyone else besides them.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Umm Salamah (RA) proved this theory false. She had not just one love of her life, but </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">two</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> true loves! Umm Salamah was married to Abdullah ibn &#8216;Abdul-Asad &#8211; also known as Abu Salamah, the father of her child. Together, they were amongst the first of those who accepted Islam and made the first emigration to Abyssinia. Although they were separated on their second hijrah to Madinah, their love was strong and endured to see them reunited until Abu Salamah died of a battle wound. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Whilst on his deathbed, Umm Salamah tearfully told her husband, &#8220;if the husband of a woman dies and he is of the people of Paradise and his wife dies after him without having remarried, Allah will bring them back together in Jannah. Let us pledge that neither of us will remarry!&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Abu Salamah asked her, &#8220;Will you obey me in whatever I request of you?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Fervently, Umm Salamah replied, &#8220;Of course!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Abu Salamah gazed at her, his heart overflowing with love for her and told her, &#8220;If I die, swear to me that you will remarry!&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While Umm Salamah looked on in shock, he supplicated to Allah: &#8220;O Allah! Provide for Umm Salamah a man who is better than me!&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Umm Salamah spent her &#8216;iddah grieving for her deceased husband, her heart breaking every time she thought of his gentleness, his kindness, his courage and his patience. As she cradled her newborn daughter, she wept at the thought that Abu Salamah would never see his daughter and that there might be no man who would be willing to raise another man&#8217;s children as his own. She thought back often on his words and wondered, in anguish, &#8220;Who could be better than Abu Salamah?&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her question was answered almost immediately: when her &#8216;iddah ended at the birth of her daughter, Zaynab, Rasool Allah (SAW) asked for her hand in marriage. In disbelief, Umm Salamah sent him a response: &#8220;I am an older woman, I am a jealous woman and I have children from my previous husband.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With his characteristic tenderness, Rasool Allah (SAW) answered her fears: &#8220;I am older than you, Allah will remove jealousy from your heart and I will raise your children amongst my own.&#8221; </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The hesitation in Umm Salamah&#8217;s heart and the remnants of her grief for Abu Salamah faded away, replaced with a sense of calmness and peace. Abu Salamah&#8217;s du&#8217;a had been answered and, once again, Umm Salamah experienced the wonder and beauty of true love&#8230; for the second time.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There are many men and women who fall in love and are devastated at its loss, whether that loss occurs through death, divorce or simply tests and trials in life that one never anticipated. The grief that one experiences can feel overwhelming and unbearable and often one wonders if they will ever be able to experience such love again. Yet, though our own concept and understanding of love is limited, Allah, al-Wadud, is not. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Messenger of Allah (SAW) said: </span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">“Verily, the hearts of the children of Adam, all of them, are between the two fingers of the Most Merciful as one heart; He directs them wherever he wills.” </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">(Sahih Muslim 2654)</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The One who placed love in our hearts for one person is easily able to heal our broken hearts and grant us the deep joy and comfort of another love in our lives – someone whom we will love not as a replacement for the person we have lost before, but as someone who will have captured our hearts in their own unique way. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">On the other hand, there is the unique situation of polygamy. It is a difficult thing for many women to understand and accept and it’s true that polygamy amongst Muslims has garnered a bad reputation with a lot of negative baggage. Even so, it is something that should be recognised – although there are many Muslim men who have done polygamy badly, there are those who have done it well and with justice. Allah (SWT) has also blessed these men with true love, not once, but twice or even several more times. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Abu Bakr (RA) is well known for being married to two great women: Umm Rumaan, the mother of A’ishah (RA) and Asmaa’ bint ‘Umays. Although he divorced his first wife, Qutaylah, who did not accept Islam, Abu Bakr cared for Umm Rumaan and Asmaa’ dearly. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When Umm Rumaan died, Rasool Allah (SAW) prayed Salat ul-Janazah over her body and lowered her into her grave saying, “Whoever wishes to see a woman from amongst the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">hoor </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">of Paradise, let him look upon Umm Rumaan!” As for Asmaa’ bint ‘Umays, Abu Bakr specifically asked that she be the one to wash his body when he died. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For men and women alike, Allah’s mercy for His creation is such that He enables our hearts to be capable of so many different types of love; He has given us the ability to love, to lose and to love again. Indeed, it is through this very blessing of His, the gift of being able to love repeatedly and in so many ways, that our hearts grow closer to Him in </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">taqwa</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> &#8211; a love born of hope and awe. Truly, who is more deserving of our love than Al-Wadud?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>{And of His signs is that He created for you from yourselves mates that you may find tranquillity in them and He placed between you love and mercy. Indeed in that are signs for a people who give thought.}</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> (</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Ar-Room:21)</span></p>

		<description><![CDATA[About two months ago I met a good friend of mine and we were walking by the [&#8230;]]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400">About two months ago I met a good friend of mine and we were walking by the lake with Ruqaya. As we were leaving each other’s company, I told her, “if I had the choice to change what happened to </span><a href="https://www.facebook.com/amr.kassem.9047"><span style="font-weight: 400">Amr</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, I wouldn’t.” She told me that she was amazed at that statement and my “strength.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">On the drive home and ever since that day, I reproached my soul many times for what I thought was a lie. I wished that I had not said what I had said. Truthfully, my heart was aching for my husband and best friend, and I would have done anything or given anything for him to return to me.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">As time passed and Allah (swt) blessed me with a bit more understanding, I started to see the merit of that statement I had initially regretted saying. If I had the choice, I wouldn’t change what happened to Amr…</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Not because every day isn’t a tremendous struggle, and not because it isn’t eating away at my heart whenever I see Ruqaya’s doe eyes staring at a picture of her Baba&#8230;but rather it is because wanting him back would mean that I trust my own judgment above Allah’s Wisdom and Judgment. How could I say that it would be “better” if something different happened besides what Allah (swt) willed? I couldn’t say that. I couldn’t believe that.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">I don’t know why I said what I said then, but perhaps those words came directly from my heart so that Allah (swt) would guide me to reflect on them later. Even through the pain, I always believe that Allah has something better in mind for me: a better plan in this world and a better destination in the hereafter, inshaAllah. </span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">My Lord, I accept. I am satisfied with You as my Lord, with Islam as my faith and with Muhammad (peace be upon him) as the final Prophet.</span></p>

		<description><![CDATA[Written by: Asmaa Hussein &#160; &#160; &#160; Most women dream of growing old with their husbands – [&#8230;]]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Written by: Asmaa Hussein</h3>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>Most women dream of growing old with their husbands – encountering their first grey hairs together, breathing a sigh of relief when their last child is finally married, and planning their retirement.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<span style="font-weight: 400">Every woman wants a partner she can lean on and build a harmonious life with. Regardless of age, no woman wishes to take on the title of “widow.”</span><br />
&nbsp;<br />
<span style="font-weight: 400">Allah (swt) says, “It is He who created you from dust, then from a sperm-drop, then from a clinging clot; then He brings you out as a child; then [He develops you] that you reach your [time of] maturity, then [further] that you become elders. And among you is he who is taken in death before [that], so that you reach a specified term; and perhaps you will use reason” (40:67).</span><br />
&nbsp;<br />
<span style="font-weight: 400">No one is guaranteed old age. The span of our lives is something Allah (swt) has already planned. He sometimes takes the people we love and rely on as a test of our faith – will we remain steadfast and patient, or will we turn away from His reminder of the brevity of this existence?</span><br />
&nbsp;<br />
<span style="font-weight: 400">When a woman loses her husband, whether to illness, accident, violence or natural causes, she is faced with the immense task of holding on to patience and raising her children – all while encountering one of the most difficult losses. The support of her family, friends and community is paramount to her emotional and physical well-being.</span><br />
&nbsp;<br />
<span style="font-weight: 400">Supporting a widow and her children is a noble task. The Prophet Muhammad (saw) said, “One who cares for widows and the poor is like those who fight in the way of Allah or those who spend their days fasting and their nights praying.”</span><br />
&nbsp;<br />
<span style="font-weight: 400">He also said, “Would you like that your heart becomes soft and that you acquire what you need? Be merciful with the orphan, pat his head and feed him from what you eat. This will soften your heart, and enable you to get what you need.”</span><br />
&nbsp;<br />
<span style="font-weight: 400">There are many ways you can support a widow and her children. Here are some of them:</span></p>
<ol>
	&nbsp;
<li><b> Remain steadfast in your friendship to her</b></li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<span style="font-weight: 400">If you are close to her, call her and visit her regularly. You can even make a schedule for your visits that work for both of you (e.g. every third Saturday). When someone is going through the loss of a spouse, having a friend consistently visit and check up on her can make all the difference to her spiritual and emotional health.</span><br />
&nbsp;<br />
<span style="font-weight: 400">Always bring wholesome, homemade food with you when you visit. Cooking is not at the top of her priority list now, and even she </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">has</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> to cook for herself or her children – she would probably rather not. If you’re bringing a meal, this will also take “hosting” pressure off of her so she can just enjoy your company without worrying about what to serve you.</span></p>
<ol start="2">
&nbsp;</p>
<li><b> Be patient with her</b></li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<span style="font-weight: 400">You want to support your friend and that is admirable. If she does not wish to have visitors at a particular time, respect her wishes for privacy – but still maintain regular contact.</span><br />
&nbsp;<br />
<span style="font-weight: 400">If you call, text or email her and she does not respond right away, don’t become upset or annoyed. She is encountering a set of emotional, financial and spiritual challenges that are very difficult. If after a day of dealing with those challenges, she doesn’t have the energy to respond to your messages, give her a break.</span><br />
&nbsp;<br />
<span style="font-weight: 400">(But don’t take that as an excuse to not maintain regular contact. You can still write to her and send her encouraging and supportive messages without always expecting a reply. She will appreciate your effort.)</span></p>
<ol start="3">
&nbsp;</p>
<li><b> Love her children</b></li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<span style="font-weight: 400">Losing the father of her children is one of the greatest sore points a widow will experience. Whereas she previously had someone to help her support, raise, discipline, and love her children, she is now faced with the task of doing all of that alone. The nagging feeling of being a single parent weighs heavily on her shoulders. While juggling her many responsibilities, she may fear that her children aren’t getting enough attention and have lost a significant role model in their lives.</span><br />
&nbsp;<br />
<span style="font-weight: 400">Love her children. Don’t just hand her an envelope with some cash in it or buy her children some toys and then ignore them (although toys are always appreciated by kids!). Come into her home and play with them, read to them, teach them something new. Take them on a trip to the zoo or to a park. Become their surrogate family member. They are now orphans, and every moment you spend supporting them is a moment in which Allah (swt) will reward you. As the Prophet Muhammad (saw) said in the previously mentioned hadith, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">you </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">are the one who will benefit from being kind to orphans.</span><br />
&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="4">
<li><b> Don’t pressure her into remarriage</b></li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<span style="font-weight: 400">Don’t pressure a widow into remarrying, especially during her mourning period. The period of four months and ten days is nobody’s but </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">hers</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">. She chooses how to mourn. She chooses what she wants to talk about, or what she doesn’t want to discuss at all. Respect her space in this time.</span><br />
&nbsp;<br />
<span style="font-weight: 400">The topic of remarriage is bound to be on her mind, and if she brings it up, discuss it with her gently. If she doesn’t, respect her privacy on the issue.</span><br />
&nbsp;<br />
<span style="font-weight: 400">If you still feel strongly that you are able and qualified to advise her on the issue of remarriage, tread carefully and employ wisdom and understanding.</span><br />
&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="5">
<li><b> Don’t unknowingly leave her out</b></li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<span style="font-weight: 400">Losing a beloved spouse leaves a widow feeling emotionally raw. Everything she hears and reads has the potential to cause those unhelpful and difficult feelings to resurface. While we should always be careful regarding what we say to people, be extra vigilant when you are interacting with her.</span><br />
&nbsp;<br />
<span style="font-weight: 400">For example, did you just invite a widow and single mother to an event with “</span><b>no children allowed</b><span style="font-weight: 400">” boldly listed on the invitation? To you it might not seem like an issue, but to someone who has lost her husband and doesn’t necessarily have access to any other regular or trusted babysitter, this could leave her feeling alienated. Make an effort to include her and her children in your activities, even if you’d rather have a child-free event.</span><br />
&nbsp;<br />
<span style="font-weight: 400">Take the time to contemplate her situation and include her in your events and gatherings.</span><br />
&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="6">
<li><b> Offer financial help – tactfully and respectfully</b></li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<span style="font-weight: 400">Losing a spouse may sometimes mean losing the family’s breadwinner. But offering a widow a pile of cold, hard cash might embarrass her or make her feel uneasy. We are commanded by Allah (swt) to care for widows and orphans in our community, but we are also encouraged to always give in a way that honours the recipient.</span><br />
&nbsp;<br />
<span style="font-weight: 400">Some people are very well meaning – they ask widows openly whether they need financial assistance. While that is admirable, more often than not, the widow will reply with a resounding “no,” even if she </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">is</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> need.</span><br />
&nbsp;<br />
<span style="font-weight: 400">It is imperative to provide help to widows and their children while still protecting their honour and dignity. So, be a good listener. Find out where she shops for her kids and get her a gift card. Is she having trouble with her old phone or computer but can’t afford a new one? Buy her one as a gift and say, “I noticed you were having trouble with your laptop, so me and a few friends chipped in to get you this new one!” Instead of being embarrassed, she will be happy that a) you noticed and listened, and b) you were caring enough to give her a </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">gift</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">, instead of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">charity</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">.</span><br />
&nbsp;<br />
<span style="font-weight: 400">May Allah (swt) grant relief and comfort to the widows and orphans of our communities, and may He abundantly reward those who seek to help and support them.</span><br />
&nbsp;<br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>

But throughout this process, through all these stages, we are healing our hearts and being prepared for a brighter future, with the help of Allah, and are able to find acceptance and even hope again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Check out this wonderful e-book, written by my-iddah.com/divorce author Amran Abdi wherein she details these stages, and offers helpful suggestions to help one move through them more smoothly.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Written by: Kaighla Um Dayo &#160; &#160; “Haraam, ukhti. How can you do this to your family? [&#8230;]]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Written by: Kaighla Um Dayo</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>“Haraam, </em>ukhti<em>. How can you do this to your family? Think of your children! Wallah, sister. Patience is better. He is a sheikh, he must be a good husband. Forgive him and give him another chance,”</em> they all told me, in various ways, countless times.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I divorced my husband, I heard the above mantra several times every day for months.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hadn’t they considered that I was a grown woman with four children to think about and would not take a decision of divorce lightly? Hadn’t they noticed I was adamant? <strong>I had given him 1,000 chances, and 1,000 more. Nothing was ever going to change.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My ex-husband tricked me into marriage, saying he was already divorced even though he was still married. He emotionally abused me by gaslighting me, stonewalling me, and telling me my feelings didn’t matter. He broke all his promises and lied to me daily. He was unreliable in every way. He neglected me and my children to please his other wife and her kids. He forced us to live a life in a developing village in Egypt, a life that even most Egyptian women would never accept. He was unfair in his time and his money.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After our divorce, I spent months in Egypt alone as a single mom. Then, I went back home to the states. Eventually, I met and married a terrific man and settled into a comfortable life in a nice town in Tennessee, and even got my sons back with me. My career took off and I even began painting again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>But there was just one problem.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>My hatred and bitterness over my ex-husband overtook my life.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I found myself brooding and planning and scheming to find ways to take him down. He didn’t deserve to stand on the minbar preaching at people to live a life he was not living. He was abusing his new wife (#2 since our divorce only 6 months previously). He was trying to blackmail me to get custody of our son. I thought of nothing but finding a way to stop him from hurting other people, to stop people from trusting him the way his charismatic personality beckoned them to.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many of my conversations with my new husband ultimately ended up revolving around my ex and what he had done to me and how the pain he caused me in those years forced me to close my heart. It became an obsession, and it ultimately caused deep pain to my new, loving husband and created a rift in our marriage.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I had come to a crossroads: hold onto the pain of the past and brood over ways to have my revenge (disguised as a genuine concern to protect others from his terror) or move forward into a bright future with my new marriage and my sons?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>See, <em>I believed that by remaining silent about what my husband had done to me, I was being further oppressed by him, and allowing him to continue to poison others.</em> I thought it was my responsibility to ruin his reputation, to bring down the belief people had in his goodness so they would stop trusting him as I used to.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But, was my effort producing results? <strong>No</strong>. He was excelling in his career as a sheikh in the masjid. He was well-loved in his new community. Was my anger and hatred serving to protect anyone else from him? <strong>No.</strong> He had no problem finding new, naive converts willing to marry him.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>My resentment and bitterness were neither effective</strong> <strong>nor helpful to me personally. <em>In fact</em>, they were hurting me a great deal and not affecting him in the least.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You know that <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00KK0PICK/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?ie=UTF8&amp;btkr=1">famous Japanese book</a> about tossing the stuff from your life that doesn’t “spark joy”? Yeah. I had to toss out my contempt because it was doing the <em>exact opposite</em> of sparking joy. It was sucking the energy from my life which I should have been using to benefit myself and my family.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you find yourself struggling with post-divorce bitterness, remember these things:</p>
<h3></h3>
<h3>1. Vengeance is His</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It was one question my husband posed to me that made me wake up: <em>“</em>Kaighla<em>, don’t you believe that God will have his vengeance on him? You are powerless to hurt him like he hurt you, but God will not allow him to escape his fate and punishment for hurting you like that. Leave it in Allah’s hands and move on,”</em> he said.</p>
<p>And that was it. Right there, he hit the nail on the head. I did not trust God to have his vengeance on my ex-husband. I did not trust that the Most Just would refuse to allow injustice to go unpunished. <strong>I did not take seriously the various places in the Qur’an that Allah talks about his wrath against oppressors</strong>, such as this one: &#8220;Consider not that Allâh is unaware of that which the Zâlimûn (polytheists, wrong-doers) do, but He gives them respite up to a Day when the eyes will stare in horror.&#8221; [Surat Ibrahim: 42].</p>
<p>Allah will not allow any injustice to go unpunished. He is the best of planners, and He has said He is on the side of the oppressed one. <a href="http://dailyhadith.abuaminaelias.com/2013/01/22/hadith-on-oppression-fear-the-prayer-of-the-oppressed-because-allah-will-respond-to-it/">No du’a offered up by one suffering from oppression is rejected by Allah</a>.</p>
<h3></h3>
<h3>2. His Plan is Perfect</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You cannot imagine the beautiful life Allah has planned for you, or the many ways in which the suffering this person gave you will ultimately benefit your life. Know that every tear of yours is noticed, and that the bends and curves in your life are ultimately for your own benefit and that Allah only wants goodness for you.</p>
<h3></h3>
<h3>3. You Are Not a Victim</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You are a survivor. You have, literally, a 100% survival rate up until this moment. That thing you thought would kill you? It failed. You succeeded in living. You have a choice to see yourself as a hapless victim and allow that mentality to cripple you, or to see yourself as a survivor of something meant to destroy you, and to refuse to allow that something to succeed.</p>
<h3></h3>
<h3>4. Forgiveness Doesn’t Mean It’s Ok</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Refusing to allow hatred and vengeance to destroy your good heart is not letting your ex off the hook. No, on the contrary, it’s you allowing yourself the space and energy to build a new life, free from the tyranny of that person. Forgiving someone does not excuse what they have done to you; forgiveness allows you to drop the baggage and bitterness of the past so you can run faster to your new dawn.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As Shannon L. Adler put it, “If you spend your time hoping someone will suffer the consequences for what they did to your heart, then you&#8217;re allowing them to hurt you a second time in your mind.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3><em>Written by: Saoirse</em></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Two opposing realities… where one is just a dream; the other a fantasy.</em></p>
<p><em>Is it your blind faith or your hopelessness?</em></p>
<p><em>What do I represent to you?</em></p>
<p><strong>‘Nothing else in the Dunya has any worth’</strong></p>
<p><em>Is it because I showed you love?</em></p>
<pre><em> </em></pre>
<p><em>Nothing by chance. Qadr Allah.</em></p>
<p><em>What significance to our meeting?</em></p>
<p><em>The implosion of two hurt souls.</em></p>
<p><em>A child so beautiful to behold.</em></p>
<p><em>What is she owed?</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>This pressure in my brain… the knowledge of what must unfold</em></p>
<p><em>A certainty against a backdrop of the untold.</em></p>
<p><em>A resolution of the irrevocable… is this all still just impossible?</em></p>
<p><em>Faith in Allah  for ‘verily He loves those who place their trust in Him.’</em></p>
<p><em>My head spins</em></p>
<p><em>At the magnitude… at the certitude… at the fact that you have become ‘that’ you.</em></p>
<p><em>Who am I to question your path?</em></p>
<p><em>Who am I to ask?</em></p>
<p><em>Have we reached an impasse?</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>‘You could never love someone like me!’</strong><em> you screamed in the dark;</em></p>
<p><em>Enraged at the wrongs that crushed your soul…</em></p>
<p><em>But the heart knows-</em></p>
<p><em>I did love you and all I wanted was to hold, console and make you whole… to fill that gaping hole.</em></p>
<p><strong>‘Tell me now that you hate me!’</strong></p>
<p><em>But I could not let you go,</em></p>
<p><em>Clinging to you as you clung to me with your desperate choke-hold;</em></p>
<p><em>Forcing me to go, willing me to know…</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Destructive cycles, self-fulfilling prophecies of old…</em></p>
<p><em>pushing me away to prove that I would go,</em></p>
<p><em>learning too late that the flagellation couldn’t break that heart-hold.</em></p>
<p><em>Putting distances of miles, centuries, and </em>insurmountables<em> between us only to be told-</em></p>
<p><strong>‘I love you and I never let you go’</strong></p>
<p><em>Even apart I always felt your soul.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>What we had wasn’t based on unity.</em></p>
<p><em>Its roots were firmly sunk in agony.</em></p>
<p><em>Did you ever even love me?</em></p>
<p><em>I can feel that nothing much remains…</em></p>
<p><em>Of what it used to be…</em></p>
<p><em>No longer ‘devotion’… a pulling away.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Do I even want you to stay?</em></p>
<p><em>What would it take?</em></p>
<p><em>A total annihilation of self…</em></p>
<p><em>Then who would I be</em></p>
<p><em>If all of me was effaced?</em></p>
<p><em>You threw it all away.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Should I relinquish who I was created to be?</em></p>
<p><em>This life is not a game.</em></p>
<p><em>Should I exist merely as an accessory to your pain?</em></p>
<p><em>You’ve lost interest…</em></p>
<p><em>As I knew that you would- all along…</em></p>
<p><em>As I knew that you would once you had attained your goal…</em></p>
<p><em>Regained control…</em></p>
<p><em>Only Allah subhanahu wa ta&#8217;ala has a claim to my soul.</em></p>
<p><em>Can I pick up where I left off when I put my life back on hold</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Move back into the light…</em></p>
<p><em>Back towards the unknown…</em></p>
<p><em>This darkness depletes me</em></p>
<p><em>Stay or go</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Living through my own recurring worst nightmare…</em></p>
<p><em>this doesn’t feel like that dream…</em></p>
<p><em>Where I lie in your arms and your love for me covers me…</em></p>
<p><em>Where you’d swallow your whole pride whole not to damage me…</em></p>
<p><em>Where you’d take on the whole wide world… just to ‘stand by me’…</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>I don’t know what scares me most…</em></p>
<p><em>Is it the eternally being without you?</em></p>
<p><em>Or that you just might let me go?</em></p>
<p><em>Or is it the stepping out into that black hole?</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>In truth</em><em> you’re already gone and were never really here</em></p>
<p><em>I was always fighting this battle alone.</em></p>
<p><em>A beautiful dream, heart-breakingly painful to recall…</em></p>
<p><em>Like a </em><em>mirage </em><em>it has always been unrealised;</em></p>
<p><em>Spurring me on… to my own demise.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>So…</em></p>
<p><em>The question then isn’t how I can change you but whether I can ‘sustain’ you</em></p>
<p><em>Or whether I’ll sever the chains that bind my soul.</em></p>
<p><em>And finally, achingly, truly let you go…</em></p>
<p><em>I don’t yet know.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Written by: Sara Woodard</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Very rarely in life are we faced with events that force us to rethink our lives, relationships, values, and future. When these events do happen, we have two choices: run and cower, or fight and thrive. When my ex-husband a</span><span style="font-weight: 400">nd I</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> separated</span><span style="font-weight: 400">, I chose to fight and thrive.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before my divorce, I was basically going through the motions. I owned and managed a website design business that became stagnant and unfulfilling. I didn&#8217;t have to worry about working very hard because I had the &#8220;benefit&#8221; of a working spouse. “Benefit” is in quotations because what his financial support amounted to was my ability to become complacent. <em>I had no real idea of what financial independence felt like.</em> This was not his fault. It was mine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also had no idea of what real love felt like. Notice I say<em> &#8220;real love&#8221;</em> and not <em>&#8220;true love&#8221;</em>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>True love speaks of birds and butterflies circling your head while you kiss passionately in the rain. Real love is squeezing in a peck on the cheek while bills and children circle your feet. Real love is working as a team against all the stress and sadness of the world. Real love is choosing each other. <em>Every. Single. Day</em>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"><strong>“Marriage isn’t 50/50. Divorce is 50/50. Marriage has to be 100/100. It’s not about dividing everything but giving everything you’ve got.”</strong> </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I would not have understood the above quote without my divorce. Most people think that love and marriage is 50/50 because there are 2 people. Pure math tells us that if 2 people work on something that means each one only needs to carry half the load. The problem is that math doesn’t work with relationships.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In a marriage, 50 plus 50 does not equal 100. It barely equals 50. </span><span style="font-weight: 400">In a marriage, 50 plus 50 equals a chasm between you both. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A very wise friend explained it this way: His wife became gravely ill. While she was ill, he was forced to carry the duties of the relationship until his wife got better. If they had a 50/50 marriage, his 50% would not have been nearly enough to carry them through. <strong>If you aren’t giving 100% in the best of times, you won’t give 100% in the worst of times.</strong> Fortunately, they had a 100/100 marriage. My friend’s 100% was magically enough to carry them both through that tough time.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My marriage ended almost 2 years ago. <em>These have been the hardest 21 months of my life</em>. Pain and sadness are expected; Self-reflection is optional. During these months, I have chosen&#8211; and have had to decide to keep choosing&#8211; to face all the emotions, including pain, betrayal, and the emptiness of dying dreams. I chose to learn how to budget my money and pay my bills on time. I chose to learn how to file my own taxes. I’ve chosen to step into my role as a business owner. I choose to continue working on my fear of failure. I will keep choosing to thrive.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My divorce was the best thing to ever happen to me because<em> it taught me the meaning of real love</em>. It taught me I can endure more than I thought possible. Divorce has forced me to evaluate my expectation of love and marriage. Because of my divorce, I will continue to strive for a 100% in my relationship with myself and in my next marriage. I will never treat a marriage like a divorce again.</span></p>

<h3>Written by: Sophia Ali</h3>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>“The expectation that we can be immersed in suffering and loss daily and not be touched by it is as unrealistic as expecting to be able to walk through water and not get wet.” </em></strong></p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8211; Rachel Naomi Remen, MD 1996 </span></em></p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Exhaustion consumed my mind, body, and soul. </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was paralyzed, but it didn’t matter because I was already detached and unmotivated. Honestly, deep down, I was just masking the truth about me and my devastating emotional state. I just wasn’t ready to face the truth head-on; it was too raw, too painful. It was easier to shove it down and ignore the whirlwind of harsh issues drowning me. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I already was overwhelmed with my daily responsibilities of being a wife, mother of three kids (2 of which have special needs), President of the PTA, and a teacher. I barely had time to get dressed properly and brush my teeth on a daily basis, let alone worry about my emotional state of emergency! </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It’s not always easy to accept the truth of our reality. Many times the pain is coming from toxic people, relationships, and negative thinking that we let invade our life. We don’t realize our God-given right and power to protect ourselves and put our needs first. Many of us get used to putting others first whether it be our kids, family, neighbors, or friends and in doing so we destroy our own well-being and health. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In addition to emotional exhaustion, you may be dealing with other compounding, critical socio-economic issues, abuse, or other health problems. Various problems divorcees and widows are faced with are: homelessness, addiction, job loss, physical/learning/mental disabilities, kids’ school responsibilities, lack of funds for basic needs, funeral arrangements &amp; costs, discrimination, and so much more. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Does this scenario sound familiar? Relatable? Do you know anyone who sounds like this?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><b>What is emotional exhaustion? </b></h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Emotional Exhaustion is a chronic state of stress that leads to:  physical and emotional exhaustion, cynicism and detachment and feelings of ineffectiveness and lack of accomplishment.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><b>Signs of Burnout</b></h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Some signs of emotional &amp; physical exhaustion include: Chronic fatigue, forgetfulness/ impaired concentration and attention, insomnia, increased illness, loss of appetite, anxiety, depression, and anger.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Cynicism &amp; Detachment often show through loss of enjoyment, pessimism, isolation, and detachment.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A feeling of ineffectiveness and lack of accomplishment is recognized by feelings of hopelessness and lack of enthusiasm, increased irritability and a lack of productivity, and poor performance.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If you are experiencing a couple of these symptoms, don’t ignore them. Assess your life and the stressors in it. See how you can reduce and remove stress from your life and do it! It will be so empowering and healthy. Currently, the few signs you may have are just “flashing yellow lights” that are warning you to slow down and balance out your life appropriately. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If you are experiencing a multitude of these signs or all of these signs, then I implore you to get professional help as soon as possible. Please don’t allow yourself to continue down this slippery slope that may end up in serious mental/ physical illness. Burnout isn’t like the common cold. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>If you ignore your burnout for a long time it will NOT go away on it’s own. YOU HAVE to take active steps to help yourself and even see the doctor if you feel it’s appropriate.</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> As hard as it may seem right now, this is the most loving thing you can do for yourself and those who are dependent on you. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Taking care of your emotional, mental, physical, and spiritual health is a religious obligation; and this health takes precedence over making other people happy. Personally, I have to remind myself of this daily. Don’t brush it under the rug any longer &#8211; face it and deal with it no matter how scary it may feel. </span><b>Remember Allah swt is the best of Helpers and is the Responder to our <a class="" href="http://islam.ru/en/content/story/dua-anxiety-and-stress" target="_blank"><span style="color: #993366">duas</span></a>. </b><span style="font-weight: 400">Allahu akbar! That alone is encouraging and a comforting promise of our Creator. </span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Written by: Zainab bint Younus</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Almost three years ago today</strong>, I fought for my right to receive a <em>khul’</em>… and received it. It was painful and exhilarating all at once; I was twenty-two years old, I had been married for almost four and a half years, and I had a three-year-old daughter. I had asked for <em>khul’</em> three times in the span of about a year, and each time I had been denied.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This last time, I stood my ground – and finally received what I knew to be my <em>Shari’ah</em> right.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The <em>‘iddah</em> (or waiting period before being permitted to re-marry)<em> </em>of <em>khul’</em> is only one menstrual cycle, unlike that of <em>talaq</em> or widowhood. Whereas a woman who has been given a <em>talaq</em> is obliged to stay within her husband’s home, I&#8211; being a woman who had chosen to leave the marriage&#8211; left my then-husband’s home as well, and spent that time with my family instead.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The night I received my khul&#8217;</strong><strong>’, my tears were of relief, excitement, and joy.</strong> The next morning, as I sailed on the ferry that would take me back to my grandparents’ home, I buried my face in my best friend’s shoulder and wept for all that had passed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My ‘iddah lasted all of two weeks, and it was a period of time marked by numerous emotions, a flash flood of exhilaration and anger, sorrow and jubilance, shattering uncertainty about the future, and a sense of renewal for my life. Every sajdah was filled with an overflowing sense of gratefulness that I had been given this opportunity that so many other women are denied; every rak’ah was performed with an aching heart and guilt at what I had chosen to do.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I wish I could say that I used my ‘iddah as a time of thoughtfulness and reflection, of heightened spirituality and increased maturity, but to be honest… to be honest, I was mostly just giddy with excitement. <strong>After four and a half years, it was a huge relief to be able to be myself again</strong>; to be able to laugh out loud, to wear a pair of shoes I liked, to be able to speak my own opinions without being censured or punished for being ‘<em>a bad wife</em>.’</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For those two weeks, though I chafed at being kept indoors by my family, I spent a significant portion of my time simply making lists of all the things I couldn’t wait to do as soon as my ‘iddah was over.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My ‘iddah was a time where I felt like I was able to rediscover myself: remembering the person I really was behind the layers of anxiety and depression and the innumerable restrictions that had been placed on my own personality. I was able to write freely again, as though someone had removed a muzzle from my heart and mind; I could speak with honesty, instead of choosing my words based on what a certain individual wanted to hear; I could finally make choices for myself again, as a grown woman, and not someone whose existence was tied to the demands of someone else.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My identity as a Muslim woman was no longer dependent on being someone’s obedient wife; my future in the Hereafter was not hinged on another human being’s mood swings. I was, for the first time in my life (or so it felt), a grown woman whose spiritual status was a matter solely between herself and her Lord.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>It was divorce, not marriage, which brought me closer to Allah and filled me with a strength of sincerity that I had not experienced in a long, long time.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When my ‘iddah ended, the first thing I did was go for a walk, hand in hand with my three-year-old daughter, retracing the neighborhood steps of my childhood and adolescence. It was here that I felt my life had come almost full-circle; here was the place that I had always felt happiest, where I had anticipated my future with eagerness, where I had experienced the early, simple struggles of adolescence and felt myself growing into the type of person I hoped to be. Now, once again, I felt the same joy and excitement, the same growing pains and the sense of discomfort that accompanies true change.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tipped my head back towards the sun, and smiled.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>{So which of the favors of your Lord would you deny?}</strong> (Qur’an 55:13)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
