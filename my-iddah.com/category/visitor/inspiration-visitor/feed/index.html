				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3><strong>Written by: Zainab bint Younus</strong></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Divorce is a hard word to say – sometimes it’s difficult to even say the word aloud due to the stigma associated to it, and it’s even worse for those who are either going through it or considering it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For women in particular, seeking divorce can be a nearly impossible task… both emotionally as well as in terms of getting the Islamic and legal divorce pronounced. Choosing to get a divorce is, in and of itself, overwhelming and a painful decision to make.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many people are quick to remind Muslim women of the hadith: <em>“If a woman asks her husband for a divorce, for no reason, then the smell of paradise is forbidden for her.”</em> (Tirmidhi) However, for most women, the word ‘divorce’ evokes depression, guilt, and fear. Not only are there serious social consequences to being divorced – whether the woman was the one who asked for it or otherwise – but there are other numerous challenges that divorced Muslim women face, such as finances, living arrangements, single parenting, and more.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Why Would a Woman Seek divorce?</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With this in mind, why would a Muslim woman seek divorce in the first place? Unfortunately, too many Muslims make the assumption that women are so ‘emotional’ and ‘irrational’ that they will demand divorce at any given opportunity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Reality, however, is quite different. Few women <em>want</em> to end their marriages and cause themselves and their children a world of pain; few women <em>want</em> to be left picking up their pieces of their lives. Most women in unhappy marriages struggle to keep those marriages going even when they themselves feel as though there is no joy or benefit left whatsoever.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is important to remember that the right to divorce is something actually granted to women in Islam; the procedure of woman-initiated divorce is referred to as <em>khul’ (divorce initiated by the wife)</em>. There are several narrations that refer to this, with the most well-known and explicit hadith being the following:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The wife of Thabit bin Qays came to the Prophet (PBUH) and said, “O Allah’s Messenger! I do not blame Thabit for defects in his character or his religion, but I, being a Muslim, dislike to behave in un-Islamic manner (if I remain with him).” On that Allah’s Messenger (PBUH) said (to her), “Will you give back the garden which your husband has given you (as Mahrdowry)?” She said, “Yes.” Then the Prophet (PBUH) said to Thabit, “O Thabit! Accept your garden, and divorce her once.”<a href="http://sunnah.com/bukhari/68/22" target="_blank">(Bukhari)</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This incident was a clear-cut case of where a Muslim woman sought a divorce from her husband and was given it by the Messenger of Allah himself – in direct contradiction to the culturally enforced belief that women are not allowed to ask for divorce at all, or that it is haram for them to do so.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Considering the first hadith warning women against seeking divorce for ‘no reason,’ what does constitute a legitimate reason for women to seek divorce? Almost all scholars agree that being deprived of her rights – whether they be financial, sexual, or otherwise – are legitimate reasons for a woman to ask for a divorce, as is abuse. If a woman’s husband takes on a second (or third, or fourth) wife and she feels that she cannot accept it, that too is a permissible reason for khul’ (divorce initiated by the wife).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, what about cases where there is no deprivation of Islamic rights, no conflict related to polygamy, and no abuse? What about if a couple is simply incompatible; if their personalities clash and they aren’t able to live with each other in peace?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>A divorce is better than a toxic marriage</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The hadith of Thabit ibn Qays’s wife once again becomes a point of reference. She explicitly mentioned that she had no problem with Thabit’s character or even his religiosity; rather, she found herself unable to live with him because of incompatibility. This was considered to be an absolutely rational and legitimate reason to seek divorce in the eyes of Prophet Muhammad (PBUH).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another famous case of incompatibility leading to divorce is that of Zaid ibn Harith – the adopted son of the prophet himself – and Zaynab bint Jahsh, the prophet’s cousin.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Their marriage was a tumultuous one, and it is recorded that both Zaid and Zaynab went to the messenger of Allah repeatedly seeking an end to their marriage. Their personalities clashed without abatement, and eventually, they did indeed resolve their issues… through divorce.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is sadly very common to find women who are struggling in their marriages and who are deeply unhappy due to issues related to compatibility, and yet feel trapped and as though they have no escape.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many times, they are told that they are simply being ‘ungrateful’ and warned that if they ask for a divorce, they will be denied Jannah itself. Yet what many people selectively overlook is that the marriage bond in Islam is supposed to be one of emotional safety and security; the Qur’an explicitly describes a relationship of <em>mawaddah </em>and <em>rahmah</em> – love as well as mercy and compassion.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>{And of His signs is that He created for you from yourselves mates that you may find tranquility in them; and He placed between you affection and mercy.}</strong> (Qur’an 30:21)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A toxic relationship is stripped of these qualities and harms both parties, rendering the Islamic purpose of marriage to be moot.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Matters become even more complicated when there are children involved. A woman who chooses to leave a marriage can very well risk custody of her children or access to them entirely, let alone the regular emotional turbulence of divorce.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Islamic legal rulings aside, however, one must recognize that toxic marriages can sometimes be even more harmful to young children than to have happily divorced parents.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A married couple who lives in bitterness are showing their children that marriage is not a source of comfort and love, but a <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/03/01/divorce-kids-_n_4862357.html" target="_blank">type of torment</a>. Watching fighting parents who have no escape from each other is infinitely more painful than having parents who are separated from each other but on their way to healing emotionally and moving on positively with their lives. Thus, leaving a harmful marriage could in fact be a <a href="http://www.livescience.com/6648-divorce-bad-kids.html" target="_blank">blessing for these children</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Divorce is not necessarily as evil a thing as many of us envision it to be. Certainly, it would not have been made permissible by Allah if it was a <em>truly terrible thing.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nonetheless, we must recognize the difference between cultural attitudes and the Islamic teachings regarding divorce. We need to understand that even the Companions of the prophet (PBUH) had unhappy marriages and sought a legitimate way to leave those relationships in favor of a happier future, and there is nothing wrong in Muslim men and women also seeking a <em>halaal</em> resolution to their unresolvable marital issues.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><em>Zainab Bint Younus (the Salafi Feminist) is a Canadian Muslim woman who tries to write thoughtfully about women of Islamic history and positive polygyny when not ranting against the patriarchy. Having sought divorce at the age of 22, she maintains that it was one of the best decisions of her life (tied with her choice to enter into polygyny and live happily ever after with her husband and best friend).</em></h4>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3><b>Written By: Annie Ahmad</b></h3>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This world and everything in it and outside of it is in the ownership of Allah, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Ar-Rahman. </span></i><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400">All that happens is as per His commands, His permission, His approval, His wisdom and His mercy for us: His slaves. We submit and bow down to Him in all circumstances.</span><br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">People come into our lives with His permission and they leave our lives with His permission. His plan is perfect and Allah (Subhanahu wa Ta’ala) does not make mistakes. There are many ways a marriage ends: by death of a spouse, Khula (separation initiated by wife), and divorce (separation initiated by husband).</span><br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The word <em>divorce</em> is a painful word, breaking marriages, love, families, homes, relationships, and hearts. It shatters everything. Although permitted, it is disliked by Ar Rahman, The Most Merciful.</span><br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My divorce at 30 with two children less than 3-years-old was rather a shock.</span><br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It happened through a series of messages and emails from my ex-husband who had been residing overseas for 1.5 years. I learned he had been unfaithful to me. We had been married for four years. I wasn’t ready to accept divorce, I feared the word more than anything. During the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">iddah</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">, I made all efforts to make things work between us and to convince him to give up on his decision of divorcing me, but it didn’t work. The waiting period ended and the Nikkah was annulled.</span><br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After this, everything changed. This was the reality of the life I was to live. It was decreed by Allah (Subhanahu wa Ta’ala) to be this way. I beseeched Allah (Subhanahu wa Ta’ala) walking, sitting, lying down&#8211; everywhere. Eventually, I submitted to His wise decision and He helped me recover through it. He healed me.</span><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400">I was starting from scratch. All the plans I had for life, the dreams, the hopes, the dependency all had to be altered to fit in the new set of circumstances. There was only myself and my two children; I had no one to depend on except Allah (Subhanahu wa Ta’ala) for everything. Although that was the case before, now it was more tangible, concrete, factual and real.</span><br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I searched for ways to find peace in my life and to be happy with Allah&#8217;s (Subhanahu wa Ta’ala) decree, pursuing a purpose in life to please Allah (Subhanahu wa Ta’ala), as He Says in the Quran, (51:56)</span></p>
<blockquote><p><a href="http://quran.com/51"><span style="font-weight: 400">وَمَا خَلَقْتُ الْجِنَّ وَالْإِنسَ إِلَّا لِيَعْبُدُونِ</span></a></p>
<p><a href="http://quran.com/51"><span style="font-weight: 400">And I did not create the jinn and mankind except to worship Me.</span></a></p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I reminded myself to be grateful to Allah (Subhanahu wa Ta’ala). If He has deprived me of the blessing of being married, there are His innumerable other blessings which I must be grateful for, including my health, my children, and my supportive, encouraging family and friends, to name a few.</span><br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It definitely was not easy for me but with Allah&#8217;s (Subhanahu wa Ta’ala) mercy and help, I am coping with this painful experience by using the following means:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b><i>Dua</i></b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I make special </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">dua</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> at </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">tahajjud</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">, observe fasting and make dua before <em>iftaar</em> and at times when I feel sad, lonely, oppressed, and broken. I pray for </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">khair</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">afiyet</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">, for ease, happiness, tranquility, success and blessings of both worlds.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b><i>Astaghfar</i></b><b> (seeking forgiveness): </b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Forgiveness is the key to all tribulations, trials, and afflictions, so I recite <em>Sayyadul Astaghfar</em> after every </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Salaat. </span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">اللَّهُمَّ أَنْتَ رَبِّي لا إِلَهَ إِلا أَنْتَ خَلَقْتَنِي وَأَنَا عَبْدُكَ وَأَنَا عَلَى عَهْدِكَ وَوَعْدِكَ مَا اسْتَطَعْتُ أَعُوذُ بِكَ مِنْ شَرِّ مَا صَنَعْتُ أَبُوءُ لَكَ بِنِعْمَتِكَ عَلَيَّ وَأَبُوءُ لَكَ بِذَنْبِي فَاغْفِرْ لِي فَإِنَّهُ لا يَغْفِرُ الذُّنُوبَ إِلا أَنْتَ</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘O Allaah, You are my Lord, none has the right to be worshipped except You, You created me and I am Your servant and I abide to Your covenant and promise as best I can, I take refuge in You from the evil of which I committed. I acknowledge Your favour upon me and I acknowledge my sin, so forgive me, for verily none can forgive sin except You.’</span></i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b><i>Submission:</i></b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I try my best to submit to </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Ar-Rahman</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">. He is the best decision maker &amp; planner, and He has decreed what is best for me and my children. I keep reminding myself of this truth time and again.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b><i>Tawakkul:</i></b></h3>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Tawakkul</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> means &#8220;reliance on Allah (Subhanahu wa Ta’ala)&#8221;.  One way to do this is by relating to the stories of the trials that the Prophets and the Sahaba experienced. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Think about how Allah saved Ibrahim (alayhi salaam) from burning in the fire; How He provided for Hajar and Ismaeel (alayhi salaam) in the desert; How He saved Yusuf (alayhi salaam) from the well &amp; the prison; How He saved Yunus (alayhi salaam) in the belly of the whale; How He saved and provided for Maryam and Essa (alayhi salaam); How He provided the best husband for Um Salamah when her husband died and for Um Habibah when her husband apostated from Islam in Abyssinia. </span></p>
<p>Allah (Subhanahu wa Ta&#8217;ala) saved them, and He will save me and you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b><i>Righteous Circle:</i></b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Surround yourself with righteous people, seek advice from them, seek help from them to recover, and share your issues with them. I was advised by a righteous lady that <strong>divorce is not all bad; it has many hidden blessings which you cannot see now, but you will see soon.</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b><i>Being Productive:</i></b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Focus on how to make your life better. Make a schedule keeping yourself productively busy. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Increase in worshipping Allah (Subhanahu wa Ta&#8217;ala); pray </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">tahajjud</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">, make voluntary fasts, make morning and evening </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">azkaar</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">, memorize some <em>surahs</em> of the Quran, improve your recitation with </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">tajweed</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">. You can also keep busy by learning a new skill such as driving, cooking, baking, homeschooling your children, volunteering, etc. <strong>Just make your intention to do everything you do to please Allah</strong> (Subhanahu wa Ta&#8217;ala).</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b><i>Focus on Allah (Subhanahu wa Ta&#8217;ala)</i></b><i><span style="font-weight: 400">:</span></i></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Focus on attaining the pleasure of Allah (Subhanahu wa Ta&#8217;ala). Every problem we face in this world comes with a solution. We might not have the solution to our problems, but Allah (Subhanahu wa Ta&#8217;ala) definitely has them. So, instead of focusing on the problem, focus on Allah (Subhanahu wa Ta&#8217;ala) and He, the Owner of All-Goodness, will make a way out for you from the impossible to the <em>“I’m”possible”</em>.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b><i>Focus on the Infinite Life of Akhirat:</i></b></h3>
<h4><span style="font-weight: 400"><strong>We cannot have “happily ever after” in this temporary life</strong>. We will face trials and tribulations and we will suffer, but we all know this life is temporary. The ratio of this life is 100 years to the Day of Judgment. 50,000 years in this world is less than 3 minutes in the next. The life in the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">akhirat</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> is infinite. The ratio of this worldly life to infinite is </span><b>zero</b><span style="font-weight: 400">, so we should shift our focus to attaining infinite success and happiness in the next world.</span></h4>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Written by: Mas-oodah Jappie</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I find that in some (or most) Muslim communities, we often prefer not to acknowledge the reality that issues like divorce exist in our world. The preference we have is to sweep anything that disturbs our state of mind under the rug and allow it to fester.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>But, the fact that divorce is rife in today’s society, the world over, is an indication that there are millions of women out there who have experienced the trials of <em>Talaaq</em> (Divorce initiated by the husband), and there must to be something that we can do to help one another.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>We all have our misconceptions or our misinformed impressions of the world; These are passed down culturally or in society. Before I got married I truly believed that <em>talaaq</em> was a scandalous word. It was saved for those who just did not work hard enough at their marriage as no one would really wish to make the Throne of Allah shake, now would they?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>I firmly believed that it would never be me.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Needless to say, my perspective definitely changed. <em>The day I realised I was one of those people I had branded, I begged Allah for forgiveness, for I misjudged and assumed.</em><br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>I wasn’t married for long, a brief five months (although it felt like years). I was young and naïve but I wanted to do things correctly. I didn’t date or go out with boys so we did things the way our grandparents and forefathers did.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Go see the girl.<br />
Like the girl.<br />
Make istikhaarah. So it’s positive?<br />
YES!<br />
Get parents to ask the girl to make istikhaarah and, well, the answer lies in her hands.</em><br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>Being the girl, it wasn’t easy either: we had to be on the receiving end. The anxiety and the patience to endure it all was so much. In my story, I had gotten married forty days after I gave my answer. I wanted to do things correctly and we did. Bubbly, boisterous little me was going to tie the knot! It had to be done the Sunnah way.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>In any case, things started to fall apart as quickly as they began.</strong><br />
Behavioural changes, mood swings, verbal outbursts, and physical altercations; and I thought it was all my fault. I knew I was young and I didn’t know much, so it had to be my fault right?<br />
The rollercoaster of emotions left me ripped of my self-esteem and confidence. I wasn’t the same boisterous, funny, and happy woman. I was self-conscious, afraid of my spouse and I was always on edge. Eventually the truth emerged, a hurtful truth. A truth that scared me.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>He wasn’t the person me or my family were led to believe he was. He was abusive and he had a drug problem, all of which frightened me, leaving me anxious every time he walked into the room. I didn’t know what to do.</strong><br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>The good girl stayed and tried to sort things out, right? I didn’t want to be a failure. What would people say?<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was too scared to do anything. In that short frame of time I found out I had fallen pregnant and that was when I reached my point of crisis.<br />
I know we all have been at that point at some time or another. Where we feel:<br />
<em>Hopeless<br />
Afraid<br />
Insecure<br />
Inadequate<br />
Incompetent<br />
Stupid<br />
Callous</em><br />
And most importantly, <em>as if we are the cause of all the strife.</em><br />
<em>“I was the problem. It is my fault! I deserve this.”</em> (That was my mantra everyday, unfortunately.)<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>I remember how I would plead every day and night unto Allah. I would cry that I would find peace and that my problems would be solved. I would cry over and over again: <em>“Allah, help. Please, help me… I need You, Oh Allah. I need you. Only You can save me. Please help me….”</em><br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>Most days I would awaken and feel as if I was drowning in an ocean of my own making. I would struggle to swim or move as the air in my lungs was banished, leaving me breathless. Just as I couldn’t take it anymore and I wanted to try and scream for help, my lungs felt as if they were on fire. All I felt was salt water gushing into my throat. The salt water choking me&#8230;<br />
Then all of a sudden I was on dry land and the burning sensation was all that was left, a reminder of the pain. I coughed and sputtered trying to bring myself back into balance.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is how I awoke on a daily basis, every single morning. I still do sometimes freeze and choke up and there is seemingly nothing that soothes me more than knowing Allah has me.<br />
I know Allah has me and that is enough for me.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>One day, 7 years ago, I put my unborn child first. I needed to provide better for her. I was almost 3 months pregnant and I needed her to grow up in a home that was safe and full of love.</strong><br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>I left.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>I came home to my mum and I have been here ever since. I have been surrounded by my loving family, my mother, my beloved sister and my amazing brothers, not forgetting my grandparents and a few special friends who didn’t judge me. They helped me along my journey.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>I wanted to be free of the shackles of his tyranny in my life, but my struggle was far from over. I wasn’t given my <em>Talaaq</em>, even though I requested it repeatedly. I needed to be punished in his eyes. He could not understand why I could not and will never go back. It was meant to make me suffer. <strong>To hurt me</strong>.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even that didn’t deter me. I had everything I could ask for from Allah. Initially, there were certain places I used to avoid as I knew it was possible I would see him there. I didn&#8217;t want to be near him. Subtle reminders of him could ruin a good day, but I was determined that would change.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>My reason for pushing on, for seeing goodness in every light, is my smiling little angel, as she makes life so worthwhile. Alhamdulillah.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>Allah is The Greatest and He hears every plea and eventually, I was free. Officially, it has been two and a half years since I received my <em>Faskh </em>(annulment).<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>When it came, it felt like a weight had lifted from my shoulders. <strong>For me, my <em>Faskh</em> had brought contentment and peace. It presented a different opportunity: an opportunity for me to change and grow and to never judge.</strong><br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not saying my <em>iddah</em> was one of joy. It was tumultuous. I had my ups and downs.<br />
<em>Iddah</em> is a reality that we have all faced in many varied, yet similar scenarios; All our stories are different but the struggles we face are similar.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Here are a few things to be aware of as a Divorcee:</strong><br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>You are still the most amazing individual you have been created to be.</strong> My beloved father used to say that Allah doesn’t make junk. So remember that you are indeed special and unique and extraordinary. Subhanallah.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Talaaq</em> and <em>Iddah</em> are not easy, but they do become easier to deal with. As women, we are created as emotional creatures who feel more deeply. To be fair there are days when it is not easy but reassuringly it will become easier. Be brave and know that you will get through this.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Learn to forgive. </strong>Allah is Oft-Forgiving. So forgive wholeheartedly.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Allah comes first.</strong> Obedience to HIM is always our first priority.<br />
Remember: Allah loves you. HE really does. If you look closer you will find HIS Blessings all around you.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The self-pity party is a definite NO-NO</strong>. Please see number 1 for further elaboration.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Support structures are important.</strong> Mum, dad, siblings, grandparents, aunts, uncles, and cousins could be a good source of support. If they want to be there for you, allow them to be.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Forgive yourself too.</strong> You also make mistakes. It&#8217;s okay. Do what is best for you. (As long as you are not trespassing the laws of Allah.)<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Smile.</strong> It eases the burdens of the heart. Find a reason in yourself to be happy.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Pray.</strong> <em>Pray a lot</em>. Make <em>Istighfaar</em> and <em>Thikr</em> and read extra <em>Quraan</em>. Read <em>Surah Mujadalah</em>. It serves as a reminder that Allah hears the plea of the women who call unto HIM. <em>Heal your heart. Heal your soul. Use this as a turning point to gain closeness to your Creator.</em><br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>Every woman treads her own path through life. Our choices of how we interact and respond to everything ultimately mould who we are. Ask yourself who it is that you want to be. Grow towards that person and become her, <em>entirely</em>.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>My journey has led me to explore and delve deeply into redefining who I would like to be as a mother, and as a woman. I see myself as a resilient, hard-working woman who loves her God and herself; A woman who is subservient to Allah and who is happy with the many blessings she has received.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>I strive every day to be a person who is happy because she knows that Allah has her. When the dark clouds loom overhead, clouding my happiness and sunshine, I try to remember that <strong>dark clouds also bring much needed rain. Rain that is needed so that life can continue and flourish.</strong><br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3><strong>Written By: Ann Stock</strong></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I waved at my children as they passed through the security gates.  My ten year old girl waved back and, with the biggest grin, shouted, “I’m off on my great adventure, Mom!”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>“Yes, and you will be just fine,”</em> I shouted back.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It would only be a week or so and I would catch up with them.<br />
It had been several months of paperwork and for some medical reasons I hadn’t received my residence visa to travel. The flights all had waiting lists as everyone was going to Saudi for ‘Umrah in Ramadhan and there was no way to delay their tickets. I would just move my ticket to First Class and fly out as soon as my visa was finished – or so we thought.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
My husband had really missed the children the previous year as he was working at his new job so he had no problem with the idea of taking them. University started after Ramadhan so he planned to have quality time with them while they waited for my arrival.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Many of my friends, who also have big families, felt that this was a gift from Allah (SWT): a week’s vacation and maybe a few days of quality ‘ibadah since I wouldn’t have the responsibility of family or cooking and all that entails. I had been taking an online course in Sha’ban about how to make the most of Ramadhan. The idea was to get yourself physically and spiritually ready for the the big event, including fasting as much as possible in Sha’ban. That way you would hit the floor running on the first day. I had big plans to make this Ramadhan the best one ever. Last year had been a big letdown for me so I wasn’t going to let another Ramadhan slip by. The cherry on the top would be ‘Umrah in Ramadhan as we would be living in Jeddah, only an hour or so away from the Ka’ba. I couldn’t wait.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The first week of Ramadhan passed and I was checking my ‘ibadah list. From time to time, I would go to my daughter’s home and have iftar with her family. I attended Taraweeh prayer at the masjid next to her apartment and found the voices of the imams so beautiful that I quickly became addicted and wound up staying quite a bit with my daughter and granddaughters. It was such a blessing that, out of my seven children, Allah (SWT) had left one of them with me so I wouldn’t be completely alone. I got time with my three granddaughters and was able to attend Taraweeh at the same time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The course I took was really paying off. One of the things we had learned is that Ramadhan is about the Qur’an and it isn’t about whether we spent an hour or two with it but rather the Qur’an is the constant and we should only interrupt that for simple cooking or quickly doing whatever is absolutely necessary for the family. It was a different way of looking at Ramadhan. I turned off the television and set up a programme for myself: I would read a juz’ in Arabic and listen to its tafseer in English while holding my Arabic Qur’an, following the English, looking at the Arabic words and thinking about their English meanings. That night, the imam would recite the juz’ and, remarkably, I was able to follow a great deal of what he was saying. This was the first time in my life that I didn’t have to worry about the ‘wandering thoughts’ condition that afflicts so many of us who don’t know what the sheikh is reciting. I thought that I had reaped the fruits of the blessing of this Ramadhan and I was confident that Allah (SWT) in His infinite mercy would soon end the paperwork and I would be off to complete my ‘Umrah. As we approached the last ten days of Ramadhan, I knew that this would not be the case. Saudi Arabia shuts down during the last ten days and I knew that if I didn’t have my paperwork before then, I wouldn’t be going. My husband and I decided he should take our three youngest on their first ‘Umrah since I probably wouldn’t make it in time. That honour was to be his alone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At Taraweeh prayers in Egypt, you pray four raka’at and then the imam gives a lesson so you can rest up before the last four raka’at. One night, he seemed to be addressing my problem. He told us how to have <em>khushoo’</em> (be at peace) in our hearts, not just our prayer. We needed <em>tafweed</em>(turning our affairs over to Allah (SWT)), <em>tawfiqh</em> (accepting or resigning ourselves to our situation) and<em> tasleem</em> (surrendering ourselves instead of fighting it). This was a combination of realising or accepting that Allah (SWT) plans our life and He is Al Hakeem, Al ‘Aleem (The All Wise, All Knowing), that He is the one in control, not us. That Allah (SWT) is the best of planners and that, in Islam, we need to submit ourselves to Allah (SWT)’s will in complete confidence that He arranges what is best for us. I was sure that I was being tested. Would I be patient? Would I be accepting or would I complain and get depressed and feel sorry for myself?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Certainly, by the last ten days I was starting to feel sorry for myself. I packed my backpack and decided to make i’tikaf at the masjid I had been attending. The masjid didn’t have a programme but women could come in at ‘Asr and stay until sunrise so I decided I would continue my own programme with that type of i’tikaf. On the first night of those precious last ten days, I found my old Qur’an teacher in the front row, setting up her little spot – “our house,” as she would call it. I couldn’t have been happier: it was a real gift from Allah (SWT) to have found her. She would be a guide for me. We were joined by two other sisters and I was soon snapped right out of my pity party. One sister was going through an ugly divorce, the other was in her late 30’s and had been unable to have children and the third one was in her mid 40’s and had never had the opportunity to get married.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>I looked at this group and found myself the blessed one. I had children, a good husband and, although they were not with me, they were there and alive and healthy and I felt so ashamed of myself. I felt I had no reason to beg Allah (SWT) for anything when I already had everything. Even if Allah (SWT) took it all away from me at that moment, I felt I had more blessings than I deserved and more blessings than many people ever have. In those last 10 days, the lessons came flooding in. The ayat of the Qur’an were popping off the pages. So many ayat I felt I was reading for the first time. I often felt Allah (SWT) was speaking right to me: addressing my problems, consoling me and encouraging me to be strong and to overcome my tests. It really helped me to cope with my overwhelming desire to see my children and grandchildren scattered in the States and in Riyadh.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I wrote this article in my third month of separation. I kept trying to increase my knowledge and started memorising Qur’an once again with my old Qur’an teacher whom I love so much. My intention in writing this article was to give other women who are experiencing trials the advice that whatever it is, it is good for you, whether you can see it now or not. My advice to you is this: do your best to hold on to the rope of Allah (SWT) and see your way through. Be patient for Allah’s (SWT) sake and look at every opportunity before you as a way to please Allah (SWT) and win His favour. Most importantly, remember Al-’Imran:8 in your du’a:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em><strong>“Our Lord!  Let not our hearts deviate (from the truth) after You have guided us, and grant us mercy from You.  Truly, You are the Bestower.”  </strong></em><br />

		<description><![CDATA[Written by: Na&#8217;ima b. Robert &#160; &#160; A part of me died four months and ten days [&#8230;]]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3><strong>Written by: Na&#8217;ima b. Robert</strong></h3>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>A part of me died four months and ten days ago.</strong><br />
But, alhamdulillah, it wasn&#8217;t hope. It wasn&#8217;t courage. And it definitely wasn&#8217;t faith and trust in my Lord&#8217;s perfect plan.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>The call that changed everything</h3>
<p>The call woke me before Fajr. My heart stopped as I tried to recognize the number on the screen. A blank. But when I answered the phone and heard the familiar voice of the doctor on the other side, I prepared myself for the worst.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
And the worst came: heart stopped beating, CPR attempted for 30 minutes, no hope.<br />
‘JazakAllahu khairan,’ I whispered hoarsely before cutting off the call. Then I immediately rose from the bed and fell into sujood of shukr. Alhamdulillah.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
It was the moment I had dreaded but also a moment I had been preparing myself for, ever since a sister, who had come to visit me at the hospital, had told me the story of a husband and wife whose daughter was desperately ill. Every time they came to the hospital, the doctors would tell them more reasons why she was not going to make it. And, at every visit, the father would turn to his wife and said, ‘Don’t forget.’<br />
This continued for several days, the doctors predicting the worst, and the husband reminding his wife not to forget, until the day they arrived and were given the news that would break any parent’s heart: <strong>their daughter had died.</strong><br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>Upon hearing the news, the husband turned to his wife and said to her, ‘Now,’ and they both fell into sujood of shukr.</strong><br />
&nbsp;<br />
The hospital staff were amazed, some of them even horrified. Surely this was a terribly sad event, one to be wept over, to be mourned, not to be celebrated with sujood?<br />
They asked the couple why, why had they done this?<br />
&nbsp;<br />
And the couple told the staff at that hospital how they had taken the decision to give thanks for their daughter’s life, for the joy she had brought them, for the love they had shared with her. Allah SWT had allowed them to love and care for her for all those years: <strong>should they not give thanks for this?</strong><br />
&nbsp;<br />
And, when I heard this story, I decided that that was what I was going to do, if it ever came to that.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Because, you see, <strong>I had no right to bemoan losing my husband, after being gifted with more happiness in 16 years than many taste in a several lifetimes.</strong> Alhamdulillah, Allah SWT guided us both to Islam and, a few short years later, to each other. My husband’s understanding and patient attitude brought out the best in me, in deen and dunyah. His way was not to command or force, but rather guide and, even, let me make my own mistakes and learn from them. As with those he worked with, his aim was always to support me in fulfilling my potential, because it was that quality that had drawn him to me in the first place (his words, not mine!). Quite simply, we understood each other, we supported each other, we were best friends and allies, as well as husband and wife. <strong>It is no exaggeration to say that, without him, I would not be the woman I am today.</strong> It was for this reason that I dedicated From My Sisters’ Lips to him, all those years ago: ‘For the wind beneath my wings’. I always prayed that any good I had done would be counted in the scale of his good deeds.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
As it was, Allah SWT took him after a bout of illness, after completing the Hajj twice (the last time, with me) and having recently taken all his children for ‘Umrah. He died a Muslim, on tawheed, in the land of the Muslims, well-loved by his family, friends and colleagues. Alhamdulillah, some things are indeed a comfort.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<h3>A deep and terrible loss</h3>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
In the days that followed his passing, I was on autopilot. There is no time for breaking down when you are a foreign national, trying to complete paperwork for a burial, on the day the British Embassy is closed for a UK holiday. I went through the motions: I Whatsapp&#8217;ed everyone to give them the news, I sat on the phone to try to get an appointment to allow his body to be buried in Egypt, as he would have wanted; I stood in crowded offices while my papers were shuffled back and forth, collecting stamps and signatures along the way.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
By the time we had finally got permission to bury him, we were late: the Dhuhr prayer was in less than an hour. My phone was dead. I knew that I wouldn’t be able to let people know about the Janazah in time. But, by that time, I was past caring.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
I observed the Janazah salah from the steps of the masjid and I said my last salaam to him in the courtyard before they took him on the long drive to the graveyard.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Surrounded by my children, my family, my in-laws, sisters, brothers, colleagues and well-wishers on every side, I felt like I was watching a scene in a movie. I played my part well: I was the gracious widow, receiving condolences, comforting others, maintaining my composure, but, in truth, my heart was aching. And yet, through it all, my faith in Allah SWT was undaunted, alhamdulillah.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
I wrote at the time: <em>I feel so incredibly blessed. Even in the midst of the trial, as the tears fall, I am surrounded by His Mercy. The du&#8217;as, the support, the love, the sense of strength and serenity, are all signs of His Mercy. Alhamdulillah, I accept. Alhamdulillah, I am at peace. Alhamdulillah, alhamdulillah, alhamdulillah is the balm for my aching heart.</em><br />
&nbsp;<br />
The next challenge, after burying him, would be mourning him, observing the ‘iddah&#8230;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Written by: Na&#8217;ima B. Robert</h3>
<p>(Read <span style="color: #993366"><a style="color: #993366" href="http://my-iddah.com/on-iddah-by-naima-b-robert-part-1/" target="_blank">Part 1</a> </span>)<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Observing the ‘iddah</h3>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
There is a delicate tension in the state of &#8216;<em>iddah</em>, the mourning period for a widow.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
On the one hand, life continues, particularly if you have children or have to work to support your family. Contrary to popular belief, <span style="text-decoration: underline">it is permitted for the widow in ‘iddah to go out during the day to fulfil her needs</span>*. The pressures, demands and responsibilities of the world are real and they won&#8217;t wait for four months and ten days to be over. Some widows find that family members take over these tasks but, in many cases, you are forced to plan, to look forward, to move on, to face the world. It can be an exquisite distraction from the pain that lies buried deep under the school run, bedtime stories and endless paperwork and deadlines. But it is still a distraction.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
On the other hand, your state of ‘iddah restricts you; you cannot fully embrace life, even if you want to. You are not supposed to wear beautiful clothes or adorn yourself in any way. Although you may have visitors and spend time with family and friends, you are expected to shun social gatherings. You are not to entertain proposals. You should observe your period of mourning in your marital home. All this means that you must pause. You must reflect. You must withdraw.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
You must face the reality, brave the darkness: the ache, the loneliness, the anger, the fear, that feeling of being utterly bereft. You must face it because it will break you down, bring you to your knees, make you feel once again that vulnerability of his last days when you would have given anything for one last apology, one last kiss, one last promise.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
You must face the reality that this is Allah&#8217;s plan for you. And that, if this is so, there <em>must</em> be khair in it for you. It&#8217;s there. It&#8217;s there in the chance to ask for forgiveness, to pour your heart out, to cleanse, to rectify your soul, to purify your habits, to be ready to emerge from your ‘iddah like a butterfly from a chrysalis: reborn, refashioned, beautiful.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<h3>The gift of ‘iddah</h3>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
For me, my ‘iddah has been a time of discovery, full of challenges, but, equally, full of triumphs. So far, I have weathered the storm. We all have, alhamdulillah.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
During my ‘iddah, I have tasted grief, a grief unlike any I have felt before. At times, I have felt a crushing and desperate loneliness, a longing for my love that threatens to suffocate me. But then I breathe, one beat, two beats, and it is soothed: Allah SWT sends me relief in the form of an ayah, or a poem, or a phone call or a sister dropping by out of the blue to listen and hold my hand and let me know that it is ok to feel.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
I have also felt, as many widows do, the weight of new responsibilities, too numerous to name. <strong>The realisation that it is all down to you now, that you are a single parent, that there is no escape from the responsibility, is a terrifying one. </strong>I have also felt the confusion, the anger, the sadness that all widows must feel.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
But, equally, with every test, Allah SWT has shown me the truth of His words: <em>‘Verily with every difficulty, there is ease.</em>’ I have held onto those words; they have kept me from drowning many, many times. By His grace, I have felt the love of so many kind and goodhearted souls who have been there for me, sometimes traveling great distances, to take the kids, to make me a cup of tea, to listen to me, to let me cry and to let me sleep for two days straight. May Allah SWT reward them with Jannat-ul-Firdaws; they have taught me the true meaning of sisterhood. I have felt the love that radiates from my children, my family and from those I do not know a thousand miles away; I have felt the thrill of strength and determination as I continue to walk forward and achieve the goals I have set for myself, for our family; and I have felt the healing balm of gratitude that continues to sustain me.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
If it is not improper to say so, I would say that <strong>I eventually found my ‘iddah period empowering</strong>. By Allah’s grace, I have been able to come to terms with and accept that my husband is no longer with us. I have come to accept and embrace the challenges that this new journey will bring. I am at peace with the decree of Allah SWT. Allah SWT promises that He will never burden a soul more than it can bear – that alone gives me the courage and confidence I need to meet the numerous challenges head-on. I know in my heart of hearts, with full yaqeen, that He did not test us with this to break us, but rather, to purify us, to lift us up. He has been my solace throughout this test and I have never once despaired of His Mercy. Alhamdulillah, He has never failed to come to my aid in my time of need. He has never failed to ‘catch me’. And He never will, bi’idhnillah.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<em>Alhamdulillah ‘ala kulli haal.</em><br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<em>Sweet stoicism</em><br />
<em> Stifles the screams,</em><br />
<em> Silences the sighs,</em><br />
<em> Sinks the soul</em><br />
<em> To numbness.</em><br />
<em> My heart is too hard to hurt.</em><br />
<em> My hands, too full to face the sky.</em><br />
<em> My eyes, too focused to tear up</em><br />
<em> With wild, wilful tears.</em><br />
<em> Forgive me, Lord.</em><br />
<em> Forgive me</em><br />
<em> And catch me</em><br />
<em> When my back finally breaks</em><br />
<em> When my heart finally cracks</em><br />
<em> When the tears finally fall</em><br />
<em> And fall</em><br />
<em> And fall,</em><br />
<em> Drowning me</em><br />
<em> And all my patience,</em><br />
<em> Strength</em><br />
<em> And fortitude.</em><br />
<em> When the agony of loss</em><br />
<em> Threatens to throw me from the cliff,</em><br />
<em> Catch me, Lord.</em><br />
<em> Catch me.</em><br />
&nbsp;<br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Written By: Nina</h3>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<span style="font-weight: 400"><strong>Those initial months after I walked out of my marriage were like walking through a deathly dream; dazed and not quite conscious.</strong> But conscious enough to feel the searing pain. It was as though I could see everyone but no one saw me, I could hear their muffled voices but nothing made sense.</span><br />
&nbsp;<br />
<span style="font-weight: 400">In the wake of any loss, a series of firsts are mandatory. </span><br />
&nbsp;<br />
<span style="font-weight: 400">In my case it was the first time I donned a hijab. </span><span style="font-weight: 400">It was my first Ramadan without the ex. </span><span style="font-weight: 400">My first time having to face family and friends who looked at me with curiosity, pity, or judgement. Or all three.  </span><span style="font-weight: 400">My first time losing family and friends who couldn’t see past their own discomfort enough to see mine. </span><br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>My first &#8216;Eid alone. </strong><br />
&nbsp;<br />
<span style="font-weight: 400">It wasn’t that I enjoyed Ramadan and &#8216;Eid a lot during my marriage, it was the fact that I knew my place and had a sense of belonging. Even though it was difficult, I knew the drill. I could pretend I was doing what I thought I was supposed to be doing: Playing the dutiful wife, keeping up (Oscar-winning) appearances. The line between pretending and reality is so very fine it blurs before you can blink</span><span style="font-weight: 400">.</span><br />
&nbsp;<br />
<span style="font-weight: 400">Subsequent days marked many more firsts in my life. They each marked and measured one thing: the huge change in my life, my utter loneliness and how ill-equipped I was at handling it all. </span><br />
&nbsp;<br />
<span style="font-weight: 400">Initially I was frozen, locked in a nightmare-like paralysis, conscious but unable to move, ridden with guilt, trying to start a life again when really, I was clutching at the wrong straws, doing most of it wrong and in all honesty, failing miserably. </span><br />
&nbsp;<br />
<span style="font-weight: 400">Somehow I made it through that first Ramadan. I mindlessly made it racked in grief and numbness.  My breath would catch over and over. Minutes felt torturous, hours endless. I don’t even remember that &#8216;Eid, it has vanished from my memory.</span><br />
&nbsp;<br />
<span style="font-weight: 400">Teetering between a new-found Islam and an inexplicable desire to jump back into the abyss of my old life, I clung on only to God. The only sure knowledge, that He would catch me. Little did I realise that He already had.</span><br />
&nbsp;<br />
As the months rolled on, I became accustomed to my life alone. I had lost in a heartbeat the life I thought I owned. My home, my things, my child’s toys. The family I would visit, the friends I would see over a BBQ or dinner. The invitations and gatherings. My job, colleagues, the bus routes and the markets I frequented alone on days off and the trains I would joyfully ride to the places I had grown to love.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<span style="font-weight: 400"><strong>Ironically I never missed him, not for a minute.</strong> He had damaged me to a depth I could not quite fathom. No, it was the routine, the pace, the sense of belonging even through the misery and horror – <em>I had a place</em>. I had now lost it. </span><br />
&nbsp;<br />
<span style="font-weight: 400"> I felt displaced as I slept on my parents’ floor, dealt with their grief of watching their girl fall apart, all the while trying to sift through my own grief. My home gone, my independence lost. Nothing felt familiar anymore. Not even myself. I was broken. </span><br />
&nbsp;<br />
<span style="font-weight: 400">I began comfort eating, put on weight, shut myself off and lost what little was left of my confidence and self-esteem.</span><br />
&nbsp;<br />
<span style="font-weight: 400">I could repeat only one thing ‘<em>Inna lillahi wa inna ilayhi raaji’oon</em>’. I held on to it as though it were a life line. </span><br />
&nbsp;<br />
<span style="font-weight: 400">I knew only the basics of my deen at the time. A newly-practising, unknowledgeable Muslim, I only knew with absolute certainty that I believed my Lord was merciful. I had never doubted His existence. </span><br />
&nbsp;<br />
<span style="font-weight: 400">I learned the story and du’a of Umm Salamah. A good woman, whose beloved husband died and left her devastated. At that moment she uttered only, </span></p>
<blockquote><p><strong><em>‘Inna lillahi wa inna ilayhi raaji’oon, Allahuma jurni fi museebati wakhlif li khayran minha’.</em></strong><br />
&nbsp;<br />
<span style="font-weight: 400"><strong><em>To Allah we belong and to Him is our return, Oh Allah recompense me for my affliction and replace it with better’</em></strong> (Sahih Muslim)</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Umm Salamah went on to marry the Prophet ﷺ. It blew my mind that her faith at her time of calamity bore such a sweet beautiful reward. </span><span style="font-weight: 400">I held on to this du’a with the last shreds of hope I had, whispering it under my breath whenever I felt hopeless. </span><br />
&nbsp;<br />
<span style="font-weight: 400"><strong>I learned slowly that if I didn’t make an effort nothing would change.</strong> I enrolled into short courses and took my child to mother and baby events</span><span style="font-weight: 400">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400">Truth be told I think I was too weak to want to live, but I was forced to do it for that little child who clung onto me day and night. I couldn’t leave him to rot in my sadness and so the fight began. </span><br />
&nbsp;<br />
<span style="font-weight: 400"><em>Step by uphill step</em>. </span><br />

		<description><![CDATA[Written by: Nina &#160; &#160; (Read Part 1) &#160; One Year Later&#8230; &#160; &#160; The following Ramadan [&#8230;]]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Written by: Nina</h3>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<a href="http://my-iddah.com/a-series-of-firsts/" target="_blank">(<strong>Read Part 1</strong>)</a><br />
&nbsp;</p>
<h3>One Year Later&#8230;</h3>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
The following Ramadan saw me in my own home. It had taken three months fixing it up which left me on a high and so proud that I could achieve something like that. My sweat, tears, and hard-saved pennies went into making that tiny home cosy and beautiful.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
I had enrolled in university and I had put my child in nursery. I made new friends from all sorts of backgrounds who made me smile. I embarked in counselling to rid myself of years of trauma and abuse at the hands of my marriage. I changed my diet and began exercising at the gym. I slowly began learning my deen. I made a few good Muslim friends.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
I began a path of healing. Even though I continued to walk a solitary path, my damaged heart began to feel strong again. I fell in love once more with life, with the beautiful colours of autumn, with the hope of spring, with the sweet haze of summer. I still cowered under my blankets through stormy winter nights, and I still wept on days when I was exhausted nursing a sick child wondering how I would manage single life. I had to work hard to survive every day, but it was satisfying and wholesome. <strong>What was tearing me down, was building me up from the inside out.</strong><br />
&nbsp;<br />
I began learning about myself. I had never known nor been given the choice to wear what I liked, to choose the décor I wanted or eat or walk or talk my way.<strong> I had been drowned out and taken over.</strong> Now it was my time to try, to fail, to succeed …it didn’t matter. It was my choice. It was liberating.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
And so I arrived meeting that Ramadan a different woman. The serene silence at Tahajud made my spine tingle knowing Allah had descended to the lowest heavens to hear me. I felt a closeness with my soul during that period of time I have seldom felt since. <strong>I do believe it was the humility that only pain can bring; it pulls you apart and leaves you raw. It opens your soul up, hungry to be heard, to be saved.</strong><br />
&nbsp;<br />
I took great solace and felt immense peace having my suhoor alone at my kitchen table without the weight of feeling bullied and belittled, without feeling broken and aching for it all to stop. I focused on Allah, I knew without a doubt He had me.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
I looked around every day knowing my du’a had been answered. I had a home once more, I had my child, I had food, friends and my family who helped me so much I could never repay them. I had my self-worth again. I was humbled and knew then I had been touched by a miracle. Allah had more than replaced everything. I had more than I had ever before because I had Him.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
I had been stumbling along, searching for contentment from the Duniyah when all along the answer had been there in a pair of cupped hands beseeching skyward, in a forehead on the floor wet with tears. I learned in that winter of my life that <strong>everything begins and ends with du’a.</strong> That du’a itself is coupled with action. At the time of calamity and certain doom when Musa (‘alayhi salaam) stood facing a sea, was he not told to strike it with his staff? Did Allah not part an ocean and save him?<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Then We inspired Musa (Moses) (saying): &#8220;Strike the sea with your stick.&#8221; And it parted, and each separate part (of that sea water) became like the huge, firm mass of a mountain.</em> (Surah Ash-Shura 63)</p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
Was Maryam not told to shake the tree whilst giving birth? In pain, in hardship she would have had little impact but she pushed anyway. She shook it and received dates, her sustenance. Her tawwakul (reliance) and effort worked in unison to bring her aid. She was a blessed woman whose patience and faith were greatly rewarded.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Yours will be, too. Just don’t give up.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Hard-earned Wisdom</h3>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
Don’t fret over tomorrow, next week or next year. Allah has already made your tomorrow and you need not meddle with it. Live in the moment and be grateful for it, savour it. Don’t waste your today in regret and worry. Save that worry and energy for du’a and get practical about how to live the most sincere life you can.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Savour each bite of food, your every moment with a loved one. Look deeply at, and beyond the sights around you. The sky, the trees; feel the air, feel the ground beneath your feet at every step and look at it all in awe, in gratitude.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
You will have to put action into changing your life. No one else can do it for you. The first step may be the hardest but it’s the most rewarding. Things are rarely as bad as they seem and if they are, the only way is up. Do what you need to do. What are your priorities? What do you enjoy? Get involved with a local charity. Throw yourself out of your problem and into someone else’s!<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Learn new skills, try new hobbies, exercise, learn a language, memorise Qur’an. Brain storm, mind map, make lists, make a plan of action and make a du’a list to get you going. It’s empowering and setting you up for better days.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Make earnest du’a. Then make more. Then make more. You get where I’m going with this. You will never lose out by calling on Allah. <strong>Even if it feels as though your du’a isn’t being heard or answered, it is.</strong><br />
&nbsp;<br />
Surround yourself with good company. Easier said than done for many, I know. But you are far better off with one or two good friends than many energy vampires. We are most vulnerable when we are being tested, so guard yourself. Your good friends will be your voices of reason when you cannot trust your own. On difficult days, on the days of your ‘firsts’ call on your friends, talk to them, reach out.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
When it comes to Ramadan and Eid do your duty, complete your fard (your obligations to Allah). With the rest, find what works for you, keep your old routine if that feels comfortable, or make new traditions. On Eid make sure you do something for you. If that means simply taking a long hot soak or buying yourself a beautiful bouquet of flowers then so be it. Be kind to yourself and love yourself, so that you can begin to love your world once more.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Know that life is a series of tests, that ease follows hardship, that difficult days do change. That He Ar-Rahman is so merciful we cannot comprehend. You don’t need all the answers, you need only <em>hope</em>.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>For hope is the beacon of light you will see flickering through the dark. That light is Allah and that light will burn brightly paving your way to Him, to comfort and relief, homeward bound.</strong><br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />

&nbsp;<br />
<strong>We asked you, the readers, to share with us some tips on having a blessed solo &#8216;Eid. </strong><br />
&nbsp;<br />
These last 10 nights of Ramadan, we have been sharing some of these tips on enjoying &#8216;Eid al Fitr as a single woman, divorced or widowed, or not yet married at all.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Here are just a few of the bits of advice you had for your sisters.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
(Note: In case you missed the tips, make sure you are following us on our <span style="color: #993366"><a style="color: #993366" href="https://www.facebook.com/myiddah/" target="_blank">Facebook page</a></span>, as well as <span style="color: #993366"><a style="color: #993366" href="https://www.instagram.com/my_iddah/" target="_blank">Instagram</a> @my_iddah</span> &amp; <span style="color: #993366"><a style="color: #993366" href="https://twitter.com/MyIddah" target="_blank">Twitter</a> @MyIddah</span>.)<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Tip #2: Be Proactive! Make Plans. Don&#8217;t wait on anyone else to plan your &#8216;Eid for you.</h3>

Many of us find &#8216;Eid a challenge every year, single or not. Things are especially hard for those of us who live in areas lacking other Muslims, or those of us who are converts and lack the support of a Muslim family structure. However, we cannot simply lie down and give up! &#8216;Eid is Allah&#8217;s gift to <strong>you. </strong>You must make the most of it, and it&#8217;s your right and responsibility to enjoy this blessed time in whatever way you choose, assuming of course that it&#8217;s <em>halaal</em>.<br />

<h3>Tip #4: Treat Yourself</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<span style="color: #993366"><a style="color: #993366" href="https://www.facebook.com/naima.b.robert?fref=ufi"><b>Na&#8217;ima B. Robert</b></a></span><span style="font-weight: 400"> says, “</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Be kind to yourself&#8230;Do something nice for yourself: buy yourself a gift, have a bubble bath, invite a few wonderful friends over, tidy up, light candles, cook a lovely meal and talk about all you have to be grateful for and all that you hope to achieve in the coming year. If you have children, create something beautiful with them: a piece of artwork, a group poem, a funny video. Say no to housework for the day and veg out with the kids, play with them, watch something funny, have a treasure hunt, a midnight feast. Then put them to bed and curl up with a lovely bar of chocolate and a good book</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">.”</span><br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<i><span style="font-weight: 400">“Focus on YOU”</span></i> <b>Nazneen S</b></span><span style="font-weight: 400">. says,  </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">“because if you feel even a little bit better, your whole attitude changes positively and the people around you (especially any children) react to that too. I learnt the hard way that I need to make myself happy/calm first, so that i can then make the kiddies happy and calm. </span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400">If not, buy yourself some nice presents, indulge in a good book, watch a movie/start a series, order a takeout. Do whatever it takes to make you feel better.”</span></i><br />

<h3>Tip #5: Arrange not to be alone</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;<br />
<b>Umm Yusha</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> tells us, “</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Don&#8217;t be alone. .. invite other widows that are able to come out. Invite elderly and reverts&#8230;. anyone else that might be alone&#8230;It sounds too painful to spend any happy occasion alon</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">e.”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<b>Zeinab S</b><span style="font-weight: 400">. said she “<em>used to invite friends in similar circumstances as me (single mothers)- we used to share breakfast after Eid salah and afterward together we would take the kids out together. One need not be alone &#8211; one can create a family from those around us. Make friends with sisters in the same boat and create memories for your kids.”</em></span><br />

&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Tip #6: Embrace the Solitude</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<b><i>“</i></b><i><span style="font-weight: 400">I found changing my mindset really helped&#8230; Instead of thinking of what I was missing, I focused on the blessings of being alone…”</span></i> <b>Kate from</b><span style="color: #993366"><b> </b><a style="color: #993366" href="https://www.facebook.com/healthymuslimah/" target="_blank"><b>Healthy Muslimah</b></a></span><span style="font-weight: 400"> says. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">“Instead of feeling lonely, I looked at the time alone as a beautiful tranquil time for self-reflection. While others were busy tending families…, I had the opportunity to sit quietly with Quran, to make dua, to eat a simple meal&#8230; I had time, I had a quiet and peaceful environment. Looking at the benefits and how I could use them to move closer to Allah made all the difference to me.”</span></i><br />

<b><i>“</i></b><i><span style="font-weight: 400">The majority of my eids have been alone, even now with my husband, also a revert, and&#8230; 3 children, we have to be inventive.”</span></i> <b>Amy H</b><span style="font-weight: 400">. tells us. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">“Trips to aquariums, interactive science center etc. have been great. The best eids I&#8217;ve had though were ones where we played with the children in the park, where we laughed and smiled. The other was where we took our canoe up the river in our local national park. We landed on a sand bar, had a picnic, just in the middle of Allah&#8217;s creation.”</span></i><br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Tip #8: Attend the &#8216;Eid Salat</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><i>“</i></b><i><span style="font-weight: 400">In the 4 1/2 years that I was divorced, I spent every single Eid on my own. My ex used to take the kids away with him and never allowed them to spend the Eid with me…”</span></i> <b>Ayesha L</b><span style="font-weight: 400">. tells us. “</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Until one day I decided enough was enough; I pushed myself out of the house and attended the Eid prayer. I stayed in the masjid a little while longer after the prayer just to give salam to my sisters. Alhamdulillah even if it was only for a hour or so I was in the company of my sisters.”</span></i><br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Tip #9: Be Grateful. Gratitude is the root of happiness.</h3>
<p>&nbsp;<br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">I’m not sure if Eid with my 3 children can be considered being alone? Last year after Eid prayers we went to the cinema, followed by a nice meal out and desserts after. The next day I surprised my kids by driving up to Birmingham, we stayed in a hotel and visited Cadburys world. Ate out again and did some abaya shopping! We had an amazing time and more fun than many of my married friends!” </span></i><b>Umm Layla</b> <span style="font-weight: 400">says.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Aisha </b><span style="font-weight: 400">F. says “</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8230;Now I have 6 children. My husband is not here in the UK with us, so I normally spend the Eid day with my sons and daughters alhamdulillah. Here in Leicester, after Eid prayer, in the masjid, there are cakes and tea and sometimes a bouncy castle for kids. We spend a couple of hours in the masjid, then we come home. Sometimes I prepare food, sometimes we go to the restaurant, or to eat an Italian &#8216;gelato&#8217; (ice cream), alhamdulillah, for me to be with my children is not &#8216;to be alone.”</span></i><br />
&nbsp;<br />
So whether you&#8217;re spending this &#8216;Eid alone, with your kids, with family, friends, or even your new husband, enjoy it til the last drop!<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<h3>&#8216;Eid Mubarak from our hearts to yours!</h3>
