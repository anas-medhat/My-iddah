				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Although commonly found in Muslim cultures, the following three rules are NOT authentic rules for the &#8216;iddah.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Having stated the requirements of <i>`iddah</i>, it is important to point out that there are a number of misgivings or misunderstandings among ordinary people concerning the dos and don’ts during <i>`iddah</i>, most of them, however, have no basis in the authentic teachings of Islam: Among them are the following:<br />
<b>1.</b> A widow in <i>`iddah</i> must never talk to any men. This is not correct; she is allowed to talk to men, regardless of whether they are her close relatives or not, so long as they observe the proper etiquettes and manners.</p>
<p><b>2.</b> She must confine herself to the sanctum of her home. This is also absolutely incorrect, as we have already stated that widows observing <i>`iddah</i> during the time of the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) were in the habit of going out to chat with their neighbors and he approved it.</p>
<p><b>3.</b> She is not allowed to put any oil in her hair. This is also incorrect, as she is allowed to use ordinary oils. She is only required to avoid scented oils, sprays, perfumes, and fragrances.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>From IslamQA.info</p>
<p>It is narrated in the hadeeth that a recently widowed woman is not allowed to do five things, and that she is required to do five things.</p>
<div class="list-group-item">
<div class="list-group-item-text ftwa-single-answer font-nrmal">
<p>1 – She should stay in her house where she was living when her husband died; this is the place where she should stay until the end of her ‘iddah, which lasts for four months and ten days, unless she is pregnant, in which case her ‘iddah ends when she gives birth, as Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):</p>
<p><i>“And for those who are pregnant (whether they are divorced or their husbands are dead), their ‘Iddah (prescribed period) is until they lay down their burden”</i></p>
<p><i>[al-Talaaq 65:4]</i></p>
<p>She should not leave the house except in case of need or necessity, such as going to the hospital if she is sick or to buy things she needs from the marketplace such as food etc., if she does not have someone with her who can do that. If the house is destroyed, then she should move elsewhere, or if she does not have anyone to keep her company and she fears for her safety, then it is OK for her to leave if there is a need to do so.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2 – She should not wear beautiful clothes, yellow, red, etc. Rather she should wear clothes that are not beautiful, whether they are black or green, etc. What matters is that the clothes should not be beautiful, as this is the command of the Prophet SAWS (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3 – She should avoid wearing jewellery of gold, silver, diamonds, pearls and the like, whether that is necklaces, bracelets or rings, etc., until her ‘iddah is over.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4 – She should avoid wearing perfume; she should avoid perfuming herself with bukhoor (incense) or any other kind of perfume, except when she purifies herself following her period, in which case she may perfume herself with a little bukhoor.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>5 – She should avoid kohl; she may not apply kohl or any similar kind of cosmetic that is used on the face, the kind of cosmetic that may attract people to her. But with regard to regular beautification by using soap and water, that is OK.  But the kohl which is used to make the eyes look beautiful and other kinds of cosmetics which some women use on their faces. This should not be done.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These are the five things which must be taken care of in the case of a woman whose husband dies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But with regard to what some of the common people think and have fabricated, that a recently-widowed woman should not speak to anyone or speak on the telephone, or that she should take a bath no more than once a week, or that she should not walk barefoot in the house, or go outside in the moonlight, and other similar myths, there is no basis for these things. She may walk in her house barefoot or wearing shoes; she may do what she needs to in her house, cooking food for herself and her guests; she may walk in the moonlight in the courtyard and garden of her house; she may take a bath whenever she wants; she may speak to whomever she wants in a manner that is not suspicious; she may shake hands with other women and with her mahrams, but not with non-mahrams; she may take off her khimaar (head cover) if there are no non-mahrams present. But she should not use henna or saffron or perfume, either on her clothes or in coffee, because saffron is a kind of perfume. No one should propose marriage to her, but it is OK to hint, but clearly proposing marriage is not allowed. And Allaah is the Source of help.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Written by: Na&#8217;ima B. Robert</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="subheading-color">The literal meaning of Iddah is &#8220;to keep count&#8221;. In Islamic legal terminology, it is the period after a woman&#8217;s divorce or her husband’s demise, in which she has been instructed to refrain from getting married again. In this article, we&#8217;ll talk about the &#8216;iddah period for <strong>widows</strong>, specifically.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="subheading-color">The period of Iddah:</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
According to the directives of Allah SWT, the waiting period for widows is four months and ten days.</p>
<p class="ayah-color">“<em>And those of you who die and leave wives behind them, they (the wives) shall wait (as regards their marriage) for four months and ten days.</em>” (Surah Al-Baqarah, Verse 234)<br />
&nbsp;<br />
If the widow is pregnant, then the waiting period is till the birth of the child, irrespective of whether it is before the 4 month 10 days period or several months after it. <em>“And for those who are pregnant, their Iddah (prescribed period) is until they lay down their burden; ”</em> (Surah At-Talaq, Verse 4)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="subheading-color">What is mourning?</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
In a hadith the Prophet (SAW) is reported as saying: “It is not lawful for a woman who believes in Allah and the Last Day, that she should mourn a dead person for more than three days except in the case of her husband whom she should mourn for four months and ten days.” (Muttafiq ‘Alaih)</p>
<p class="subheading-color">Mourning is:</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<strong>1.To refrain from adornment.</strong><br />
A widow observing the waiting period, should not beautify herself in any way or wear ornaments. She should not wear attractive clothes or bright colors. All kinds of make-up including henna and kohl is forbidden; neither can she apply perfume or wear jewelery.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Wisdom: The wisdom of this instruction to adopt simplicity is two-fold: it is done to show respect and honour for the sanctity of the marriage bond and the time spent with her husband; also to avoid the possibility of receiving marriage proposals.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>2.To avoid going out.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
</strong>During the waiting period, the widow should not leave her house except if it is for some important reason (the necessity of which is left to her judgement based on her Taqwa- her love, respect and fear of Allah).<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p class="subheading-color">Livelihood Requirements:</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
During the waiting period, if there is no one else to do this for her, a widow is allowed to go out for absolutely unavoidable tasks, such as going to the doctor, taking the children to school, shopping for groceries etc Similarly, if she has no one to provide for her and no other means of income, and she needs to earn her livelihood, then it is permissible to take up employment, resume her job in order to ensure it’s continuity, or as is the case in villages, to work on the land and tend to the cattle. However the other conditions of Iddah must be observed i.e. simplicity and lack of adornment and returning home before nightfall. (Allah knows best)<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p class="subheading-color">Abroad or During Haj:</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
If she has permanent residence abroad or if she is widowed during an overseas visit, where the local laws do not allow her to stay on, then she should return to he own country. Similarly, if she is widowed during Haj, it is naturally not possible for her to stay there, and in these situations, the instruction to spend the Iddah period where her husband passed away does not apply. She can return to her own country to spend the waiting period in her own home.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
The Prophet (SAW) said:</p>
<p class="hadith-color">“<em>Allah does not go after your bodies and appearances, but He scans your hearts</em>.”( Muslim)</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Written by: Annie Ahmad</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The literal meaning of<em> iddah</em> is “keeping count”, but most commonly it is defined as the waiting period for the widow or divorcee during which she cannot remarry.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It is obligatory for every woman whose marriage ends with her husband&#8211;either through divorce or <em>khul&#8211;</em> or whose husband leaves her by way of death, to observe <em>iddah</em>. The number of days is different for each circumstance. For example, in the case of a woman who is pregnant, her <em>iddah</em> ends when she gives birth, as Allah<em> Subhanahu </em>wa<em> Ta’ala</em> ordains in the </span><span style="color: #993366"><a style="color: #993366" href="https://quran.com/65/4"><span style="font-weight: 400">Quran, Surah Talaq 65:4;</span></a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color: #993366"><a style="color: #993366" href="https://quran.com/65/4"><span style="font-weight: 400">“And for those who are pregnant, their term is until they give birth.”</span></a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"><em>Iddah</em> is not obligatory upon the woman whose marriage ended before consummation, as Allah <em>Subhanahu </em>wa<em> Ta’ala</em> says in the </span><span style="color: #993366"><a style="color: #993366" href="https://quran.com/33/49"><span style="font-weight: 400">Quran, Surah Ahzaab 33:49;</span></a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color: #993366"><a style="color: #993366" href="https://quran.com/33/49"><span style="font-weight: 400">“O You who have believed, when you marry believing women and then divorce them before you have touched them, then there is not for you any waiting period to count concerning them. So provide for them and give them a gracious release.”</span></a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p></blockquote>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400">Iddah for Widows (waiting period after the death of one&#8217;s husband)</span></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The widow waits for four months and ten days after her husband’s death, as Allah <em>Subhanahu </em>wa<em> Ta’ala</em> commanded in the </span><span style="color: #993366"><a style="color: #993366" href="http://quran.com/2/234"><span style="font-weight: 400">Quran, Surah Baqarah 2:234;</span></a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color: #993366"><i><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;<a style="color: #993366" href="http://quran.com/2/234">And those who are taken in death among you and leave wives behind &#8211; they, [the wives, shall] wait four months and ten [days]. And when they have fulfilled their term, then there is no blame upon you for what they do with themselves in an acceptable manner. And Allah is [fully] Acquainted with what you do.</a>&#8220;</span></i></span></p></blockquote>
<h1></h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"><em>Iddah</em> by way of death is a sudden, shocking occurrence and most of the time, she wasn’t expecting to lose her loving husband and the father of her children and was not prepared for this. Therefore, this unexpected blow of life requires lengthier time to grieve, recover, and heal from it. The woman grieving the loss of her husband needs time to collect herself and to plan to move ahead after this big change which has caused a havoc in her life.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400"><em>Iddah</em> for Divorce by <em>Talaaq</em> (initiated by Husband)</span></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The<em> iddah</em> in case of <em>talaaq</em> (or divorce uttered by the husband) is three menstrual cycles, as Allah <em>Subhanahu </em>wa<em> Ta’ala</em> declares in the </span><span style="color: #993366"><a style="color: #993366" href="https://quran.com/2/228"><span style="font-weight: 400">Quran, Surah Baqarah 2:228;</span></a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color: #993366"><a style="color: #993366" href="https://quran.com/2/228"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Divorced women remain in waiting for three periods”</span></a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">and she must continue staying at the marital home, as Allah <em>Subhanahu </em>wa<em> Ta’ala</em> says in the </span><span style="color: #993366"><a style="color: #993366" href="https://quran.com/65/1"><span style="font-weight: 400">Quran, Surah Talaq 65:1</span></a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color: #993366"><a style="color: #993366" href="https://quran.com/65/1"><span style="font-weight: 400">“O Prophet, when you [Muslims] divorce women, divorce them for [the commencement of] their waiting period and keep count of the waiting period, and fear Allah , your Lord. Do not turn them out of their [husbands&#8217;] houses, nor should they [themselves] leave [during that period] unless they are committing a clear immorality. And those are the limits [set by] Allah . And whoever transgresses the limits of Allah has certainly wronged himself. You know not; perhaps Allah will bring about after that a [different] matter.”</span></a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If the muslimah does not menstruate or her period is irregular typically, then her<em> iddah</em> is three lunar months, as Allah <em>Subhanahu </em>wa<em> Ta’ala</em> says in the </span><span style="color: #993366"><a style="color: #993366" href="https://quran.com/65/4"><span style="font-weight: 400">Quran, Surah Talaq 65:4</span></a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color: #993366"><a style="color: #993366" href="https://quran.com/65/4"><span style="font-weight: 400">“And those who no longer expect menstruation among your women &#8211; if you doubt, then their period is three months, and [also for] those who have not menstruated.”</span></a></span></p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"><em>Iddah</em> is meant to lengthen the time before full divorce and the wisdom behind spending the waiting period in the house of the husband is so that his heart may soften by seeing his wife daily. He may rethink the matter and perhaps reconsider his decision of divorce and contemplate taking his wife back.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In case he doesn’t take his wife back and the waiting period ends, then the three menstrual cycles spent as<em> iddah</em> also serve to establish whether she is pregnant or not.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In <em>talaaq </em>divorce, the muslimah is not the one deciding to end the marriage with her husband, but she is submitting to her husband’s decision of divorce, which is a very devastating experience for the woman and her children, so this requires time to heal and recover from the agony of divorce.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400"><em>Iddah</em> for Divorce by <em>Khul</em> (divorce initiated by the wife)</span></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"><em>Khul</em> can occur only at the request of wife and the husband’s subsequent agreement to end the marriage.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The ruling of <em>iddah</em> in case of a marriage ending by khul is one menstrual cycle as derived from the hadith narrated from Ibn Abbas<span style="color: #000000"> </span></span><span style="color: #993366"><a style="color: #993366" href="https://islamqa.info/en/14569"><span style="font-weight: 400">that the wife of Thaabit ibn Qays ended her marriage to her husband by means of khula’ at the time of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) asked her to return the garden which her husband had given her as <em>mahr</em>, and when she had, he commanded her to observe an ‘<em>iddah</em> of one menstrual cycle. (Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 1185; Abu Dawood, 2229. Also narrated by al-Nasaa’i (3497)</span></a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the case of <em>khul</em> where the wife has taken the decision to leave the husband and is not going to go back to her husband, the <em>iddah</em> of one menstrual cycle is sufficient to establish whether she is pregnant or not and to give her time to heal from the previous unsuccessful marriage experience.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400">In the end, this life is temporary</span></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"><em>Iddah</em> is meant to be a very secluded, private, personal time for a muslimah. The wisdom behind this solitude is to find yourself. It is invested in rethinking, re-organising and re-planning her life, her goals, and her pursuits after her husband leaves. She is now single again, free to decide for her life and to grow, to learn, and to pursue things she wants.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"><strong>It is meant to strengthen your relationship with Allah, to hear your inner voice, to remember and see your shortcomings in order to avoid repeating them, and to make yourself understand that at the end, this life is temporary.</strong> What you lost was just a temporary loss and what you will gain from exercising patience and obeying Allah <em>Subhanahu </em>wa<em> Ta’ala</em> in face of this calamity will be permanent happiness in Jannah, <em>inshaAllah</em>, where there will be no heartbreak, only love and happiness between spouses.</span></p>

		<description><![CDATA[From IslamQA.info The ‘iddah of a woman whose husband has died is four months and ten days, [&#8230;]]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>From IslamQA.info</p>
<p>The ‘iddah of a woman whose husband has died is four months and ten days, because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):</p>
<p><i>“And those of you who die and leave wives behind them, they (the wives) shall wait (as regards their marriage) for four months and ten days”</i></p>
<p><i>[al-Baqarah 2:234]</i></p>
<p>This period begins when the husband dies, and ends when the time is over, whether the wife adheres to the rulings on mourning or not, and whether she knows of her husband’s death or not. When four months and ten days have passed from the time of his death, then her ‘iddah ends.</p>
<p>Ibn Qudaamah (may Allaah have mercy on him) said (8/93): The scholars are unanimously agreed that the ‘iddah of a free Muslim woman who is not pregnant is four months and ten days from the death of her husband, whether the marriage had been consummated or not, and whether she was an adult who had reached puberty or very young and had not yet reached puberty. That is because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): <i>“And those of you who die and leave wives behind them, they (the wives) shall wait (as regards their marriage) for four months and ten days.” </i></p>
<p>The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “it is not permissible for a woman who believes in Allaah and the Last Day to mourn for any one who dies for more than three days, except for a husband, four months and ten days.” Agreed upon.</p>
<p>It says in <i>Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah</i> (20/421): The woman whose husband dies must observe ‘iddah for four months and ten days if she is not pregnant. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):<i>“And those of you who die and leave wives behind them, they (the wives) shall wait (as regards their marriage) for four months and ten days”</i>. That starts from the date of death. If a woman deliberately does not observe mourning then she is sinning, and she has to repent and seek forgiveness.</p>
<p>It also says (20/481): The ‘iddah for one whose husband dies is four months and ten days immediately following the death, and until giving birth if she is pregnant.</p>
<p>Thirdly:</p>
<p>A woman who is observing iddah following her husband’s death may go out of the house during the day to meet her needs, such as dealing with government procedures if there is no one who can do that for her. But at night she should not go out except in cases of necessity.</p>
<p>Ibn Qudaamah (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in <i>al-Mughni</i> (8/130): The woman who is observing &#8216;iddah may go out and do errands during the day, whether she is divorced or widowed, because of the report narrated by Jaabir who said: My maternal aunt was thrice divorced and she went out to harvest her palm trees. A man met her and told her not to do that. She mentioned that to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and he said: “Go out and harvest your palm trees; perhaps you will give some of it in charity or do some good.” Narrated by al-Nasaa’i and Abu Dawood.</p>
<p>Mujahid narrated: Some men were martyred on the day of Uhud and their wives came to the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and said: O Messenger of Allaah, we feel scared at night; can we stay in the house of one of our number, then in the morning we will go to our own houses? The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Chat together in the house of one of your number, then when you want to sleep, each one should go to her own house.” She does not have the right to stay overnight anywhere but in her own house, or to go out at night, except in cases of necessity, because night is a time of suspicion, unlike the day, which is the time when people go about their errands and earn a living, and buy what they need.</p>
<p>It says in <i>Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah</i> (20/440): The basic principle is that a woman should mourn in the house of her husband where he died, and she should not go out except in cases of need or necessity, such as going to the hospital if she falls sick or buying what she needs from the marketplace such as bread and the like, if she does not have anyone who can do that.</p>
