		<description><![CDATA[Written by: Asmaa Hussein &#160; &#160; &#160; Most women dream of growing old with their husbands – [&#8230;]]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Written by: Asmaa Hussein</h3>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>Most women dream of growing old with their husbands – encountering their first grey hairs together, breathing a sigh of relief when their last child is finally married, and planning their retirement.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<span style="font-weight: 400">Every woman wants a partner she can lean on and build a harmonious life with. Regardless of age, no woman wishes to take on the title of “widow.”</span><br />
&nbsp;<br />
<span style="font-weight: 400">Allah (swt) says, “It is He who created you from dust, then from a sperm-drop, then from a clinging clot; then He brings you out as a child; then [He develops you] that you reach your [time of] maturity, then [further] that you become elders. And among you is he who is taken in death before [that], so that you reach a specified term; and perhaps you will use reason” (40:67).</span><br />
&nbsp;<br />
<span style="font-weight: 400">No one is guaranteed old age. The span of our lives is something Allah (swt) has already planned. He sometimes takes the people we love and rely on as a test of our faith – will we remain steadfast and patient, or will we turn away from His reminder of the brevity of this existence?</span><br />
&nbsp;<br />
<span style="font-weight: 400">When a woman loses her husband, whether to illness, accident, violence or natural causes, she is faced with the immense task of holding on to patience and raising her children – all while encountering one of the most difficult losses. The support of her family, friends and community is paramount to her emotional and physical well-being.</span><br />
&nbsp;<br />
<span style="font-weight: 400">Supporting a widow and her children is a noble task. The Prophet Muhammad (saw) said, “One who cares for widows and the poor is like those who fight in the way of Allah or those who spend their days fasting and their nights praying.”</span><br />
&nbsp;<br />
<span style="font-weight: 400">He also said, “Would you like that your heart becomes soft and that you acquire what you need? Be merciful with the orphan, pat his head and feed him from what you eat. This will soften your heart, and enable you to get what you need.”</span><br />
&nbsp;<br />
<span style="font-weight: 400">There are many ways you can support a widow and her children. Here are some of them:</span></p>
<ol>
	&nbsp;
<li><b> Remain steadfast in your friendship to her</b></li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<span style="font-weight: 400">If you are close to her, call her and visit her regularly. You can even make a schedule for your visits that work for both of you (e.g. every third Saturday). When someone is going through the loss of a spouse, having a friend consistently visit and check up on her can make all the difference to her spiritual and emotional health.</span><br />
&nbsp;<br />
<span style="font-weight: 400">Always bring wholesome, homemade food with you when you visit. Cooking is not at the top of her priority list now, and even she </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">has</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> to cook for herself or her children – she would probably rather not. If you’re bringing a meal, this will also take “hosting” pressure off of her so she can just enjoy your company without worrying about what to serve you.</span></p>
<ol start="2">
&nbsp;</p>
<li><b> Be patient with her</b></li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<span style="font-weight: 400">You want to support your friend and that is admirable. If she does not wish to have visitors at a particular time, respect her wishes for privacy – but still maintain regular contact.</span><br />
&nbsp;<br />
<span style="font-weight: 400">If you call, text or email her and she does not respond right away, don’t become upset or annoyed. She is encountering a set of emotional, financial and spiritual challenges that are very difficult. If after a day of dealing with those challenges, she doesn’t have the energy to respond to your messages, give her a break.</span><br />
&nbsp;<br />
<span style="font-weight: 400">(But don’t take that as an excuse to not maintain regular contact. You can still write to her and send her encouraging and supportive messages without always expecting a reply. She will appreciate your effort.)</span></p>
<ol start="3">
&nbsp;</p>
<li><b> Love her children</b></li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<span style="font-weight: 400">Losing the father of her children is one of the greatest sore points a widow will experience. Whereas she previously had someone to help her support, raise, discipline, and love her children, she is now faced with the task of doing all of that alone. The nagging feeling of being a single parent weighs heavily on her shoulders. While juggling her many responsibilities, she may fear that her children aren’t getting enough attention and have lost a significant role model in their lives.</span><br />
&nbsp;<br />
<span style="font-weight: 400">Love her children. Don’t just hand her an envelope with some cash in it or buy her children some toys and then ignore them (although toys are always appreciated by kids!). Come into her home and play with them, read to them, teach them something new. Take them on a trip to the zoo or to a park. Become their surrogate family member. They are now orphans, and every moment you spend supporting them is a moment in which Allah (swt) will reward you. As the Prophet Muhammad (saw) said in the previously mentioned hadith, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">you </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">are the one who will benefit from being kind to orphans.</span><br />
&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="4">
<li><b> Don’t pressure her into remarriage</b></li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<span style="font-weight: 400">Don’t pressure a widow into remarrying, especially during her mourning period. The period of four months and ten days is nobody’s but </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">hers</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">. She chooses how to mourn. She chooses what she wants to talk about, or what she doesn’t want to discuss at all. Respect her space in this time.</span><br />
&nbsp;<br />
<span style="font-weight: 400">The topic of remarriage is bound to be on her mind, and if she brings it up, discuss it with her gently. If she doesn’t, respect her privacy on the issue.</span><br />
&nbsp;<br />
<span style="font-weight: 400">If you still feel strongly that you are able and qualified to advise her on the issue of remarriage, tread carefully and employ wisdom and understanding.</span><br />
&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="5">
<li><b> Don’t unknowingly leave her out</b></li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<span style="font-weight: 400">Losing a beloved spouse leaves a widow feeling emotionally raw. Everything she hears and reads has the potential to cause those unhelpful and difficult feelings to resurface. While we should always be careful regarding what we say to people, be extra vigilant when you are interacting with her.</span><br />
&nbsp;<br />
<span style="font-weight: 400">For example, did you just invite a widow and single mother to an event with “</span><b>no children allowed</b><span style="font-weight: 400">” boldly listed on the invitation? To you it might not seem like an issue, but to someone who has lost her husband and doesn’t necessarily have access to any other regular or trusted babysitter, this could leave her feeling alienated. Make an effort to include her and her children in your activities, even if you’d rather have a child-free event.</span><br />
&nbsp;<br />
<span style="font-weight: 400">Take the time to contemplate her situation and include her in your events and gatherings.</span><br />
&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="6">
<li><b> Offer financial help – tactfully and respectfully</b></li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<span style="font-weight: 400">Losing a spouse may sometimes mean losing the family’s breadwinner. But offering a widow a pile of cold, hard cash might embarrass her or make her feel uneasy. We are commanded by Allah (swt) to care for widows and orphans in our community, but we are also encouraged to always give in a way that honours the recipient.</span><br />
&nbsp;<br />
<span style="font-weight: 400">Some people are very well meaning – they ask widows openly whether they need financial assistance. While that is admirable, more often than not, the widow will reply with a resounding “no,” even if she </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">is</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> need.</span><br />
&nbsp;<br />
<span style="font-weight: 400">It is imperative to provide help to widows and their children while still protecting their honour and dignity. So, be a good listener. Find out where she shops for her kids and get her a gift card. Is she having trouble with her old phone or computer but can’t afford a new one? Buy her one as a gift and say, “I noticed you were having trouble with your laptop, so me and a few friends chipped in to get you this new one!” Instead of being embarrassed, she will be happy that a) you noticed and listened, and b) you were caring enough to give her a </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">gift</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">, instead of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">charity</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">.</span><br />
&nbsp;<br />
<span style="font-weight: 400">May Allah (swt) grant relief and comfort to the widows and orphans of our communities, and may He abundantly reward those who seek to help and support them.</span><br />
&nbsp;<br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3><strong>Written by: Fatima Asmal</strong></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At the end of the day, we are all but human.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">I was always obsessed with the idea of marriage. </span><span style="font-weight: 400">Before my first marriage, I wanted to marry and I did. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For six years after that ended, I was even more obsessed with the idea of getting married.  So much so, that I married a man who had already proven himself to be extremely abusive during our engagement period. Verily with every difficulty comes ease, and from that miserable situation my son, Amr, my greatest blessing was born.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The obsession started to wane thereafter but didn&#8217;t completely leave me, and a few years after that I married yet again&#8230;</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Again, not the wisest of choices of a partner, and when I was asked to make a choice between that unstable marriage and my son, I chose Amr.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I never looked back thereafter. The desire for male companionship which had always prevailed within me died, and I focused all my energies on my son, parents, close friends, and my two careers &#8211; one in journalism and the other in running a charity I founded called &#8220;ILM-SA.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But like I said, we are all human.  And every now and then &#8211; ever so seldom- I do reflect about the way my life has turned out &#8211; living at my parents&#8217; home with them and my son.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once, a couple of years ago, I had to have my mum admitted into the hospital. This entailed taking her from our family doctor to her specialist and then sitting for hours in a waiting room trying to arrange for her medical aid and admission.  My son was a lot younger and anxious. I had to ask my best friend to babysit him. Rush home, pack my mummy&#8217;s bag, rush back. I had to somehow work him into the equation because he didn&#8217;t want to be away from me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then there was the time Amr was severely dehydrated. Again, a friend was asked to take me to a doctor.  Another friend was summoned to take us to the hospital.  She &#8211; may Allah Reward her &#8211; swiped her credit card at admission (yes his father reimbursed her later on but that was not an overnight process or one free of interrogation). I remained at his side at the hospital, talking him through procedures. Packing us clothes and essentials was the responsibility of my mum, may Allah bless her.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Recently, after a wedding, we were at my aunt&#8217;s house, when my mother starting throwing up and feeling extremely dizzy. By the time everyone had left, she was unable to stand up unassisted due to her blood pressure and sugar levels being abnormally high. At close to midnight or perhaps thereafter, I called my cousin who is our family doctor and she got out bed, accompanied by her son, to check on mum.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mum had to stay at my aunty&#8217;s house that night, and so there for the umpteenth time in my life you had me, a single woman (and not the best of drivers) driving along on not the safest routes to get home. There were rocks on some parts of the road, puddles and potholes elsewhere. And since I am but human, I wondered, <em>&#8220;How different would my life me if I was married to a decent human being?&#8221;</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My little man seated next to me brought me out of that thinking. He told me when to drive slowly and how to avoid dodgy parts of the road. At home, he locked the gates and turned off all the lights. He told me he loved me. He cuddled me till he fell into a deep sleep.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Few people in my close family have ever deemed it appropriate to introduce me to anyone. I was always labeled ‘lazy’ (because I&#8217;m not a chef) and ‘big mouth’ (because I speak my mind).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the wedding I mentioned earlier, a female family member suggested she introduce me to someone who was also attending. I declined because it is not the right time for Amr and I currently, but I was touched.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"><em>“What do these incidents have to do with anything?”</em> you may be asking.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, I feel that there are very few non-judgmental people in our community, people who recognize that it is possible for a woman not to be entirely responsible for her three failed marriages. People who recognize that a lack of love for the kitchen doesn&#8217;t equate to a lack of love in a woman&#8217;s heart. People who equate straight-forward-ness with sincerity and not having a big mouth. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As Amr grows older and these incidents like mum and him getting ill occur, I do concede that some day I may elect to marry again and perhaps when that day arrives Allah will send forth a non-judgmental individual, open-hearted enough to introduce me to a mature, open-hearted, generous man for whom marriage is much, much more than sexual gratification.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For now, I must say I would not have come this far in one piece without a close-friend who has really over-extended herself in our regard, without my mum, without my dad, without my Amr, without Allah, and without the Good Samaritan matchmakers who remind me that I am still human.</span></p>

		<description><![CDATA[Written by: Khurshid Khatib &#160; Marital breakdown is acknowledged to be one of life’s most stressful experiences. [&#8230;]]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3 style="text-align: left"><strong>Written by: Khurshid Khatib</strong></h3>
<h4></h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Marital breakdown is acknowledged to be one of life’s most stressful experiences. As well as huge personal turmoil, the failure of a marriage may bring with it financial burdens or the upheaval of a move to a new home. Also, in cases involving children, there are the traumatic issues of custody and court proceedings. Divorcees may also have to consider the prospect of raising their children alone, a situation that few will have envisaged for themselves.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At this very difficult and emotional time, as with many life-changing experiences, a valid support system is essential. But it would appear that there is a relative lack of empathy for single Muslim mothers amongst many within the Muslim community.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When Misbah Akhtar became a single parent, she found that having gone through the very painful processes of separation and divorce, she then had to endure the stigma inflicted upon her by those who turned away, instead of offering support. Faced with the daunting prospect of raising her children alone, she realised that <em>‘there were no support networks or organisations in place to help Muslim women who were left feeling isolated and dejected, and that there must be other women out there, like her, who were also struggling and who would benefit from having a support group’.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Misbah started writing a blog and also set up <a href="https://singlemuslimmums.wordpress.com/" target="_blank"><span style="color: #993366">‘<em>Single Muslim Mums</em>’,</span></a> an internet forum where other single Muslim mums could share their worries, offer tips and advice and help alleviate loneliness. Whilst support groups are available for single parents, Misbah thinks that <em><span style="color: #993366">‘<a style="color: #993366" href="https://www.facebook.com/SingleMuslimMums/?fref=ts" target="_blank">Single Muslim mums</a></span> are not encouraged to come forward to speak about their feelings and women are being made to feel ashamed. They are not always speaking up, and some say they don’t want to be seen as complaining, but it’s not about that; it’s about raising awareness, because [these women] do not always know their rights in Islam’.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Misbah aims to make her network a registered charity and is working hard towards achieving this goal. She is looking to offer counselling services from professionals who will be able to provide more long-term support. She sees this as being two-tiered and says, <em>‘the first will be an online option, where sisters can write in with problems which they need advice for and discuss their feelings, and overlapping this will be another online service providing child psychotherapy, which will go into more detail regarding child behaviour and, if applicable, the sister receiving free psychotherapy sessions for her child. </em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>The second part of the counselling service, </em>insha<em> Allah, will be a phone service&#8230;more as a &#8216;crisis&#8217; line for those feeling particularly low. The volunteers will have details for other relevant organisations too, where they can pass sisters onto if this is something we cannot help with. Of course, it&#8217;s early days yet, and Allahu ‘aalim, but these are my plans’.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Often, the blind following of ignorant cultural practices totally overlook the reality of true Islamic values based on compassion and kindness towards one another</strong>, and this misrepresentation is instead wrongly and dangerously being taken as accurate. Misbah acknowledges that she is speaking from her perspective which is culturally a Pakistani one, and says that, <em>‘Culture often clashes with religion. This appears to be especially true on the issue of remarriage, where divorced women are often under pressure to marry <strong>anyone</strong></em> <em>because they get told that no-one will look at them now’</em>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In a positive move, she says that the <em>‘younger generation are finding out more about their rights and particularly second time around, but there are double standards when it comes to divorced men who </em><em>can [often] marry a woman who has not previously been married’.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I ask Misbah what she would like to see with regards to being able to help other single Muslim mums, and she emphasises the importance of <em>‘urging people to talk about these issues and to raise awareness, perhaps at the mosque, for example, because particularly for those living alone and who are vulnerable, these women are the mothers of the future ummah, and instead of supporting them, they are being isolated’.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8230;The importance of such an online support network cannot be underestimated; loneliness compounded through a ‘blame culture’ can only serve to weaken the self-esteem of already fragile women who, without adequate emotional support, may become vulnerable to depression or anxiety and struggle to cope with the demanding role of motherhood.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is no air of ‘victim-like’ mentality coming from the voices of these women; this is about an urgent call for recognition that single Muslim mothers need, and are searching for, support from other Muslim women. Viewing the huge response and feedback from her online group within less than six months, the need for connection between single Muslim mums is clear. Negative opinions and attitudes can often apply to divorce regardless of cultural ideas or religious beliefs. It must also be remembered that not all attitudes are going to be similar, however, it is of great concern that the damage felt by divorcees appears to be greatly underestimated, if considered at all. Instead, these women are often being met with prejudice and subsequent exclusion.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Divorce rates amongst Muslims are increasing, resulting in a growing number of single Muslim mothers. The hurt caused by unnecessary stigma and isolation is exacerbated by those who continue to impose their own inaccurate version of Islam and are ignorant and forgetful of the consideration that should be given to those undergoing hardship&#8230;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The real irony of this situation is that there are many other women who are in the same position and difficulties. In this respect, they are almost certainly not alone.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Written by: Aneesa Sidat</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It’s been a tough week.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bereavement is difficult, especially when coping with the loss of a family member.  Not only is it a struggle for yourself to come to terms with, but when trying to help young children deal with the loss and accept a death, the personal challenges get tougher.</p>
<h4></h4>
<p>In my case, it was tougher still as it was <em>my ex-father-in-law</em> who sadly passed away (May Allah grant him a high rank in Jannah) whom I still very much consider family, not only as my children&#8217;s’ grandfather but as someone I loved and cared for.</p>
<h4></h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The biggest challenge I faced this week was how my involvement would be perceived. My ex was out of the country dealing with the funeral and I was regularly attending his brother’s home here in the UK to pray and pay my respects.  It was natural for me to take my children there to spend time with their family, particularly in the absence of their father who would otherwise have done so. As one would with any other family member, it was also natural for me to support the family during their difficult time.  However, I was always aware of my intentions being misconstrued by distant family and friends. Nevertheless, I ignored those fears and did what I believed to be “the right thing” for Allah’s sake.</p>
<h4></h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This may seem unusual to most, however, personally I do not understand why families should be torn apart following a divorce, particularly where children are involved.  In most South Asian families, culturally a divorce means a broken family, quite literally.  In some situations, both parties are closely related yet it is very common for families to suddenly become estranged.  This <em>baffles</em> me.  <strong>Have I missed something in the Islamic texts where we should forget a network of friendships, sisterhood and feelings of closeness overnight, because of two people not getting along?</strong></p>
<h4></h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Seven years ago when I knew my marriage was over and I decided to get out, the thought of breaking ties with the rest of the family was more difficult to accept than the divorce itself.  It is devastating to contemplate letting go of people you love after spending <em>years</em> building up those relationships.  It was clear in my mind that I could recover from losing my husband&#8211; especially since I was initiating the split&#8211; but I could not deal with my children suffering further by not being as close to their extended family as they would have if their parents had stayed together.  It seemed unfair for me to impose that upon them, so I tried my very best to keep them close.</p>
<h4></h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The key factor here is that <em>I have children</em>.  Maintaining a healthy relationship with their father’s family is beneficial to them. I know that, and so do my former in-laws.  As I have primary custody, they appreciate me taking the children to visit occasionally around their father’s family visits, are free to offer advice in relation to the children’s best interests and know I would do the same.</p>
<h4></h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As the divorce was my choice, staying friendly with my ex’s family does not look like I wish to stay close to him, as it would appear if he initiated the split.  I have still built up my own life independently from them and our now-fairly-infrequent contact has benefitted the children <em>immeasurably.</em></p>
<h4><em> </em></h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Of course, there are boundaries and limits</strong>, as we see each other much less frequently and I do not get involved in their family events and functions, especially if he is around.  Between us, the children see a lot of his family and I hope they don’t feel they have been disadvantaged in any way because of our divorce.</p>
<h4></h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was invited to another ex-brother-in-law’s daughter’s wedding.  Being asked to attend the wedding last year was without a doubt one of the hardest things I have ever had to do. Of course, I went. Why wouldn’t I?  I keep in contact with my children&#8217;s cousins and it would be rude to refuse an invitation! I wasn’t worried about my former in-laws as they still consider me to be part of the family.  I wasn’t concerned about awkwardness with my ex because of segregation at the wedding.</p>
<h4></h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was, however, <em>very apprehensive and anxious</em> about the inevitable rumours which would fly around the community by family friends, distant relatives, and all those guests who weren’t familiar with my setup.  A few of those guests did ask me directly if I had got back together with my ex-husband and I told them I appreciated them asking me so that I could explain why I was there.  They understood that from an Islamic point of view, it was perfectly logical.</p>
<h4></h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regardless of whether our intentions of maintaining ties are solely for making the divorce easier for the children, it doesn’t matter.  We all equally care for them and this means a lot to me and no doubt to their father too.</p>
<h4></h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Of course, things may have to change if either of us remarries.  Not only would my ex’s wife or my husband not appreciate and be uncomfortable with this friendship, but visiting the former in-laws would cause a lot of awkwardness!  Again this is not an Islamic necessity.  If the new spouse is mature, understanding, and perhaps has children of their own, keeping friendships is still possible, within strict limits.</p>
<h4></h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After 7 years, especially now at the time of his father’s death, my ex-husband fully appreciates that my maintaining a positive relationship with his family has greatly benefited his children as they were able to grieve with their family in his absence.</p>
<h4></h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I strongly believe that if you focus on the greater good, go forth without having a bitter, closed heart and have your intentions clear from the outset, a divorce can be less painful, not just for you but also for your children.  May Allah make this a possibility for all and give families the strength to see it through for the childrens’ best interests.  Ameen.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Written by: Annie Ahmad &#160; Going through divorce means you’re no longer a part of a couple [&#8230;]]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4>Written by: Annie Ahmad</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Going through divorce means you’re no longer a part of a couple and everything is disrupted: your home, your relationships, your peace of mind, your routine, and your responsibilities. It is tough for a woman and more-so demanding if you have children in the picture.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before divorce, the couple is performing different roles; the mother’s roles often include nurturing, loving, caring, cooking, cleaning, educating, and moral &amp; spiritual upbringing of the children. The father’s roles usually mean providing, protecting, guiding, leadership, responsibility, Islamic development and correct Islamic nurturing of the child.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Both of these roles and all of these responsibilities now have to be managed by the single parent and it is challenging.</strong> To perform the dual responsibility of mother and father requires a lot of patience &amp; reliance on Allah (Subhanahu wa Ta’ala) and lots of dua.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Upbringing &amp; Nurturing of the children</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Minimize the emotional impact of divorce on children</h4>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
Divorce is one of the most stressful life-events for children. As a single parent, you have to have a strong presence in the lives of your children. To take care of their emotional needs, you have to minimize the impact of divorce on the innocent minds of your children.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
You have to be there for them, make extra efforts to meet them with a smiling face, spend time together, make memories, play, listen to them, tell them stories from the Quran &amp; Sunnah, and do stuff together with them. All this effort will give them the compassion, care, love, and affection which they need, so as to make them compassionate additions to the Muslim ummah InshaAllah.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Education &amp; Moral Development Needs</h4>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
You are the one to decide what form of education is best for your child, whether you choose homeschool or conventional schooling, whether he/she should join public school or an Islamic one, whether he/she should become a hafiz/a (one who has memorized the entire Quran), and more.<br />
The time spent together in educational activities and learning new things will be more fulfilling and strengthen your parent-child relationship.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>Children are <em>sadaqa jaria</em> (charity that extends beyond your life on earth) and you are their role model. They will see and emulate you in their actions.</strong> The more you become a better Muslim and have an Islamic lifestyle, the lesser are the chances of your children going astray.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Managing Your Emotional needs</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Spirituality</h4>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
Have full Tawakkul (reliance) on Allah (Subhanahu wa Ta&#8217;ala). He (Subhanahu wa Ta’ala) has decreed the best for you &amp; your children. Focus on becoming spiritually strong by making dua, praying tahajud (extra night prayer), performing voluntary fasts, giving sadaqat (charity), Quran recitation, and morning &amp; evening azkar.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Doing all of these acts of worship will help to keep you emotionally and psychologically composed. Quran recitation, for example, calms and heals. In it is a healing for the ailing heart, Allah (Subhanahu wa Ta&#8217;ala) says in the Quran (13:28)<br />
الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا وَتَطْمَئِنُّ قُلُوبُهُم بِذِكْرِ اللَّهِ ۗ أَلَا بِذِكْرِ اللَّهِ تَطْمَئِنُّ الْقُلُوبُ<br />
“Those who have believed and whose hearts are assured by the remembrance of Allah . Unquestionably, by the remembrance of Allah hearts are assured.”<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<h5>Astaghfar</h5>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
Astaghfar (seeking forgiveness from Allah) is a very powerful tool; it is mercy and hope in our times of emotional distress and financial tribulations. It’s a secret to success in both the <em>dunya</em> and <em>akhirat</em> for us, Muslims. It brings us closer to Allah (Subhanahu wa Ta&#8217;ala) when we seek conscious repentance of our sins, big and small.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Allah (Subhanahu wa Ta&#8217;ala) says in the Quran; (71:10-12)</p>
<blockquote><p> وَيُمْدِدْكُم بِأَمْوَالٍ وَبَنِينَ وَيَجْعَل لَّكُمْ جَنَّاتٍ وَيَجْعَل لَّكُمْ أَنْهَارًا o يُرْسِلِ السَّمَاءَ عَلَيْكُم مِّدْرَارًo فَقُلْتُ اسْتَغْفِرُوا رَبَّكُمْ إِنَّهُ كَانَ غَفَّارًا<br />
<em>&#8220;And say, &#8216;Ask forgiveness of your Lord. Indeed, He is ever a Perpetual Forgiver. He will send [rain from] the sky upon you in [continuing] showers. And give you increase in wealth and children and provide for you gardens and provide for you rivers.&#8221;</em></p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5>Gratefulness</h5>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/emotional-fitness/201311/how-the-habit-gratitude-leads-happiness" target="_blank">Gratefulness is the key to happiness</a>.</strong> Make an effort to be grateful. You could make a gratitude list and try to write your blessings and keep adding to the list as you remember them. Then, when you’re feeling down you can go through the list and remember your blessings. This will make you thankful and happy and it will deepen your trust in Allah (Subhanahu wa Ta&#8217;ala). You will remember that He has blessed you and He will bestow more of His bounties on you. Allah (Subhanahu wa Ta&#8217;ala) says in the Quran about being grateful to Him:</p>
<blockquote><p>وَإِذْ تَأَذَّنَ رَبُّكُمْ لَئِن شَكَرْتُمْ لَأَزِيدَنَّكُمْ ۖ ٌ<br />
<em>And [remember] when your Lord proclaimed, &#8216;If you are grateful, I will surely increase you [in favor] (14:7)</em></p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5>Dua</h5>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
He (Subhanahu wa Ta’ala) has planned our lives perfectly and we are in this trial for a reason. We should make grand <em>duas.</em> Ask much from Allah (Subhanahu wa Ta&#8217;ala) for this world and also for the <em>akhirat. </em>He will surely grant you your requests and make you happy and contented in His ordained divine decree. For Him (Subhanhu wa Ta’ala), nothing is difficult and only He (Subhanahu wa Ta’ala) can make the impossible possible, so draw closer to your Creator, Allah (Subhanahu wa Ta&#8217;ala).<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Taking care of yourself</h4>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
No one can take away your pain and suffering from you except Allah (Subhanahu wa Ta&#8217;ala).<strong> Your health and your well-being are very crucial if you want to care for others, especially your children.</strong> So make efforts to look after yourself, protect yourself, and nurture yourself, so that you have the health and energy to take care of your responsibilities and live a gratifying life.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Support network: family &amp; friends</h4>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
Being alone is very devastating; You need a listening ear, someone to share the burdens with, and someone to assist in your responsibilities. Make a support network, reaching out to your family and friends, sharing with them, and seeking their help in your everyday activities.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Planning your day</h3>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
Managing your home and providing for yourself and the children is hectic and cumbersome, but can be done by following a schedule and using some time-management tactics.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Early morning barakah</h4>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
It is proven to be successful to start off your day early; Allah (Subhanahu wa Ta&#8217;ala) puts barakah in our time and efforts if we start with scheduling our day after Fajr, as we learn in a hadith: Prophet Muhammad (sallalahu alaihi wassallam) made dua; <em>&#8220;O Allah, bless my nation in their early mornings (i.e., what they do early in the morning).&#8221;</em><br />
&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Productive life: Constructive busyness</h4>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
Don’t be worried. Over-thinking and getting anxious brings no joy and no improvement; standing still only makes you drown. Concentrate on living a productive and fulfilling life. Keep moving forward in life! Stay busy in a constructive way, doing activities which make you happy. Gain knowledge of new skills, polish your existing talents, take up hobbies and new interests, and do everything with the intention to pleasing Allah (Subhanahu wa Ta&#8217;ala).<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Handling Financial Needs</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Double the reward:</h4>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
In Islam even after divorce, it is the father’s responsibility to provide for the children, but unfortunately, fathers don&#8217;t always do their part, and in most cases the mothers have to work to provide for the children after being abandoned by their husbands. <strong>So rest assured you will get your reward in the<em> akhirat</em> of being both a mother and a father</strong>, of being patient in the trials of this life, and of having your rights denied by your ex. Allah (Subhanahu wa Ta&#8217;ala) will make ease for you in this life also, so make abundant dua.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><p>Allah (Subhanahu wa Ta&#8217;ala) says in Quran (Surah At-Talaq 65:3)<br />
وَيَرْزُقْهُ مِنْ حَيْثُ لَا يَحْتَسِبُ ۚ وَمَن يَتَوَكَّلْ عَلَى اللَّهِ فَهُوَ حَسْبُهُ ۚ إِنَّ اللَّهَ بَالِغُ أَمْرِهِ ۚ قَدْ جَعَلَ اللَّهُ لِكُلِّ شَيْءٍ قَدْرًا<br />
<em>&#8220;And will provide for him from where he does not expect. And whoever relies upon Allah &#8211; then He is sufficient for him. Indeed, Allah will accomplish His purpose. Allah has already set for everything a [decreed]  extent.&#8221;</em></p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Job search</h4>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
You have to find ways to re-enter the job market if there is no one to support you financially. Be patient and persistent in your job search, have confidence in yourself, think well and banish away negative thoughts and you will find work which meets your strengths, bi&#8217;ithnillah.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Career &amp; Education enhancement</h4>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
You can think about taking some short courses or trainings to enhance your career, you can choose to complete your education by pursuing a degree course; these will help you find better job opportunities in your profession.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Work heals</h4>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
Work generates self satisfaction, confidence and independence, having control of your life and your decisions, it enhances social circle; overall keeping busy earning is a beneficial and constructive task and work can be a healing element.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Life is a struggle and a test. You have to keep reminding yourself that <strong>you are not alone in this struggle</strong>. Allah (Subhanahu wa Ta&#8217;ala) is with you. This part of your journey is a part of His Merciful plan, even if you you can’t comprehend how now, eventually you will see and recognize the wisdom behind it.<br />
&nbsp;<br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Written by: Fatima Asmal</h3>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
As a woman who has been divorced three times, I can tell you that it was only the <em>Ramadaan</em> after the first divorce that was trying. I was very young then and felt that my world had come to an end.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I knew he was going to divorce me on <em>&#8216;Eid-ul-Adhaa</em>, and that <em>&#8216;Eid</em> was a horrible one, even though I was at my grandmother&#8217;s house and there were many family members there. I remember anticipating the divorce alone or with my mum in my granny&#8217;s room, crying and making every <em>duaa</em> I could possibly think of that he would change my mind.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Many years later I married again. I spent one and a half <em>Ramadaans</em> with that husband, one of which was in Egypt. The marriage was a miserable one. In Egypt, I tried to be part of a sisterhood and that helped somewhat, but not entirely.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
During the second <em>Ramadaan</em> I was in the UK, a new mother. Thankfully, I had my mum with me. Nonetheless it was a dark, sad <em>Ramadaan</em>, full of pain and sadness.<br />
And during my third marriage, <em>Ramadaans</em> were equally sad.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>My best <em>Ramadaans</em> have been as a single woman</strong>, living at home with my parents and brother many decades ago, and now, at forty years old, living with my parents and my young son. My mum and I sometimes perform <em>Salaah At-Taraweeh</em> in <em>Jama&#8217;ah</em> at home. Sometimes I take my son to the masjid. Sometimes we go out for <em>iftaar</em> with fellow single mums and their kids. <strong>We are a happy lot in <em>Ramadaan</em> at <em>Suhoor</em> time and <em>Iftaar</em>.<br />
</strong><br />
&nbsp;<br />
I run a charity here in South Africa and <em>Ramadaan</em> is the busiest time of the year &#8211; there really is no time to be lonely. It&#8217;s about befriending the <em>Qur&#8217;aan</em>, drawing closer to it, organising classes in which the <em>Qur&#8217;aan</em> is taught, feeding the hungry, standing the night in prayer, and running a holiday programme for kids.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
On <em>&#8216;Eid</em> day mum, dad, my son Amr and I celebrate the day with 200 underprivileged kids and their teachers in a park &#8211; it&#8217;s colourful and fun &#8211; there&#8217;s togetherness and food and prayer and play. At night our extended family comes over, and yes, <em>sometimes on <em>&#8216;Eid</em> night I feel alone because everyone at that dinner gathering is married.</em> But last year we started inviting my single mum friend and her sons, and two years ago my cousin was widowed, so now I don&#8217;t feel so obviously alone, and <em>&#8216;Eid</em> is a day on which I go to bed feeling exhausted and fulfilled.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<h4>What advice would I give to recently divorced women for <em>Ramadaan</em> and <em>&#8216;Eid</em>?</h4>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
Firstly, <em>Ramadaan is a month in which we can focus on seeking Eternal Companionship</em>, Divine Companionship, befriending Allah, befriending His Book, and praying hard. It doesn&#8217;t have to be about male companionship.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Secondly, unless a sister lives a very isolated life in a community cut off from civilisation, it is possible to <em>become involved in worthy efforts like volunteering time</em> to old-age homes, hospices, orphanages, shelters, soup kitchens, etc and this kind of activity really brings a new meaning to life.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Thirdly, if at all possible, <em>create a sisterhood of people in a similar situation to you</em>. This helps you, as well as your kids.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Lastly, when you want to cry tears of utter despair at your lot in life, being unmarried etc, <em>make those tears worthwhile by throwing your head on the prayer mat and crying to the One who has a Plan for you</em>.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />

&nbsp;<br />
In this video <strong>&#8220;Life After Divorce: What About the Kids?&#8221;</strong>, Fatima tells us about the realization that finally gave her the courage to leave her abusive marriage, with five kids in tow, one of whom is a spastic paraplegic.<br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Written by: Zainab Bint Younus</h3>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
There is a huge stigma in the Muslim community regarding the remarriage of widows and divorcees, especially those with children. Many Muslim men, whether they themselves are divorced/widowed or not, will shy away from considering remarriage with a woman who has been previously married, and more so when there are children involved. <strong>There is a sense that these women aren’t ‘good enough’ and that marrying them is somehow inferior to marrying a woman who has never been married before.</strong><br />
&nbsp;<br />
When Abu Salamah (RA) passed away, Umm Salamah (RA) already had several children – Salamah and ‘Umar, and was pregnant with yet another. For most Muslim men today, considering a previously married woman with one child for marriage is seen as alarming, never mind three or more! There appears to be some sort of revulsion at the idea of caring for “another man’s children.” However, neither Rasool Allah (SAW) nor his Sahabah ever expressed this type of attitude.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
When Umm Salamah’s ‘iddah ended by giving birth to her daughter, Zaynab bint Abi Salamah, Rasool Allah (SAW) – fully aware of her situation – proposed to her. When Umm Salamah pointed out that she had several children to take care of, <strong>Rasool Allah (SAW) reassured her with the simple words: “Your children are my children.”</strong> (Narrated by an-Nasa’i)<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Those words were not spoken meaninglessly. While Zaynab bint Abi Salamah never grew up with her biological father, she was raised by a man who was her father in every other way – Rasool Allah (SAW). It is narrated that whenever Rasool Allah (SAW) came to visit Umm Salamah, one of the first things he would do is ask, <em>“Where is our Zinaab?”</em> (‘Zinaab’ was an endearment for the name ‘Zaynab’).<br />
&nbsp;<br />
One narration states that when she was young, her mother asked her to attend to Rasool Allah (SAW) while he was making wudhu. When she entered, Rasool Allah sprinkled her face with the water from his ablutions, and for the rest of her life, she remained looking youthful, barely revealing any signs of aging.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Zaynab’s bond with Rasool Allah (SAW) was evident to others as well. Her uncle ‘Ammar used to pick her in his arms and say: “She is the one who has come between the Prophet (SAW) and his family.” (i.e. She was distracting him and keeping him busy as he used to give her a lot of attention.)<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>Imagine growing up in an environment knowing not only that your mother was the wife of the Messenger of Allah (SAW), but to have him in your life as a father-figure</strong>, someone who was there literally from the first moments of your life, someone who cared for you as his own child, of whom your first memory is the endearing nickname he gave you? Rasool Allah (SAW) was much more than just a stepfather to Zaynab bint Abi Salamah – In the true sense of the word, he was her father.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
The effect that Rasool Allah (SAW) had on Zaynab bint Abi Salamah was an incredible one. Not only did he impact her emotionally by being a loving father-figure and providing a stable family environment, but she was also affected spiritually. How could she not when she grew up witnessing the Wahy (revelation) being revealed, when he would wake up his entire household to pray Qiyaam al-Layl in Ramadhan, when she heard his Divinely inspired words straight from his lips?<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Zaynab bint Abi Salamah grew up to be a direct reflection of the environment she grew up in. She narrated seven ahadith directly from Rasool Allah (SAW), and she also narrated from others amongst the sahabah, in particular, her stepmothers, the other wives of Rasool Allah, such as ‘Aishah (RA), Umm Habibah (RA) and others.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Zaynab quickly grew to become known as an incredible scholar of Madinah, particularly in the field of fiqh. The famous Imam among the Tabi’un, Abu Rafi’ al-Sa’igh, referred to her as the most knowledgeable woman of her time on many occasions. Amongst her students were her son Abu ‘Ubaydah, Muhammad bin ‘Amr bin ‘Ata, ‘Irak bin Malik, Humaid bin Nafi’, her foster-brother ‘Urwah bin al-Zubayr, Imam Zain-ul-‘Abidin ‘Ali bin al-Hussain, ‘Amr bin Shu’ayb, al-Qasim bin Muhammad, Abu Qilabah, Salamah bin Abdur Rahman and others.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
One particular incident demonstrated the true breadth of her patience as well as her wisdom.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
During the Hurrah (a rebellion against the governor of Madinah) in the reign of Yazid bin Mu’awiyah, she lost two of her sons in battle. On hearing the news, she proved herself to be a mountain in sabr as well as a true faqihah (scholar of fiqh). Holding her dead son before her, Zainab said: <em>“To God we belong and to Him we return! As for the first, he didn’t fight anyone but was ambushed and killed in his home. For him I am hopeful of Jannah. But the other one fought, and I am not aware what his intention was in fighting, and so the travesty for me is even greater in his loss (as I don’t know in what condition he met His Lord).”</em><br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>Truly, Zaynab bint Abi Salamah was a heroine not only in her time, but for all time.</strong><br />
&nbsp;<br />
SubhanAllah, all of this was because Rasool Allah (SAW) chose to marry Umm Salamah (RA), a widow with several young children.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Nor was Rasool Allah (SAW) alone in his practice of welcoming the children of previously married women into his family and raising them with as much love and affection as his own children. When Ja’far ibn Abi Talib (RA) was martyred, he had a number of young children with his wife, Asmaa’ bint ‘Umays (RA). Rasool Allah (SAW) himself assured Asmaa’ of her children’s safety and security. As an answer to the promise of Rasool Allah, Abu Bakr (RA) proposed to Asmaa’, and the sons of Ja’far ibn Abi Talib were thus raised in the household of Abu Bakr.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>Not only was Abu Bakr willing to care for them as his own children, but he was also in fact honoured to do so.</strong> The children of Ja’far were granted the double blessing of not only having a martyr, beloved to Allah (SWT) and His Messenger (SAW), as their biological father, but to also have the greatest of the sahabah as their stepfather.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
While blended families are becoming more and more common in society in general, they are still relatively rare and even taboo in Muslim communities. Even if both a man and woman agree to such a marriage, the family pressure and community scepticism can be overwhelming.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
The idea of a man raising another man’s children is looked down upon and criticised, yet it is precisely those men who had the courage to do so, men such as Rasool Allah (SAW) and Abu Bakr (RA), who were responsible for raising these children to become some of the greatest heroes and heroines of Islamic history.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>It is high time that we embrace this Sunnah</strong>, not only acknowledging the challenges that inevitably accompany it, but the incredible rewards and payoff for doing so, in both this world and the Hereafter. Who knows? It could likely be the children raised in such a way are the very thing to bring us to the gates of Jannah.<br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Review by: Kaighla Um Dayo</h3>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
It is a rare experience indeed to come across a work of fiction written by a Muslim author that is able to convey the deep spirituality of Islam without being too heavily evangelical in its approach. <span style="color: #993366"><a style="color: #993366" href="https://hendhegazi.wordpress.com/about-me/" target="_blank">Author Hend Hegazi</a></span> manages this feat with ease in her novel,<span style="color: #993366"> </span><em><span style="color: #993366"><a style="color: #993366" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01HSPKG8K/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&amp;btkr=1#nav-subnav" target="_blank">Behind Picket Fences</a></span></em>.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Sharing the deeper truth behind four sets of picket fences, Hegazi manages to show us how deeply deluded we are when we assume that what we see in the lives of those around us &#8212; yes, even our closest friends&#8211; is the whole truth. She presents us with four different families in four very different circumstances and stages in life and marriage.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<h4>The Couples</h4>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
One couple, May and Hasan, have a beautiful marriage and a healthy family life in this little subdivision. They are practicing Muslims who draw their strength from their dedication to Allah, both as individuals and as a couple. But Allah has plans for them they never imagined coming and challenges the reader is not sure they will overcome.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Mariam and Morgan are also a God-fearing family, though not specifically Muslim. They are blessed with healthy children and a humble home, but Morgan is always seeking better, his envy being his worst characteristic while Mariam works to care for her family and see the beauty in her simple life.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
What Mariam and Morgan have, Sidra and Farris lack. While they are blessed with much in the way of material gain, there is something amiss. Hegazi leaves us in suspense throughout the book, turning corners and finding new evidence with each chapter on this interesting couple. Though a dedicated Christian, it&#8217;s unclear just how dedicated Sidra is to her husband Farris.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Rounding out the couples is Summer and Porter, a non-Muslim, non-religious newlywed couple. Summer, an artist and a free spirit, has found her art lacking in passion and herself unable to sell paintings when a mysterious stranger comes into her life offering a unique opportunity. Porter is a dedicated husband, a business-minded man, who supports his wife&#8217;s art but wishes she would be more practical.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Hegazi presents well-rounded, deep characters in this short book, telling us as much as possible about each couple and each individual to give us a clear understanding of the unique blessings and challenges they face. Her use of short, concise chapters leaves you feeling excited to find out the next move of each couple. Being a predominantly non-fiction writer and reader myself, I was able to read this book in the span of about 3 days, without ever feeling bored or tired of the plot-line.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<h4>An Example for Divorcées</h4>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
Without giving away too much, one of the couples ends up choosing the path of divorce, and it&#8217;s anything but amicable. However, the wife and husband each handle their divorce differently, one turning to God and nearness to Him for strength, dedicated to continuing to raise her children with the moral ground and spirituality she began with, while the husband chooses to find his solace in less-than-<em>halaal</em> ways.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
The example set by this woman in dealing with the prospect of ending her marriage is one we should all attempt to follow. As far as her ex-husband falls away from God, she does not allow it to drag her down, nor does she attempt to return wrong for wrong. She remains mature and classy in the face of his poor character choices, and it is clear her first priority is the well-being of her children, come what may.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
She does not try to keep her children away from their father out of spite, and in fact only decides to keep them with her during his time when she sees they are in real danger. She always keeps the offer open for him to come to her home to see the children whenever he would like to. Then, when she sees that her ex-husband has showed en effort to change his ways, she immediately agrees to sending her children to his apartment, knowing deeply that their relationship with their father is as important for their maturity and growth as their relationship with her.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
She makes sure to keep their conversations focused on what is best for the children, rather than bickering over how and why their marriage fell apart. When her ex-husband tries to take the conversation to that arena, she immediately refocuses on the topic at hand without being threatening or rude. Her firm refusal to argue with him about things is really an example to follow.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Subtle Spirituality</h4>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
Hend Hegazi offers us an honest, realistic look at what is really happening behind-the-scenes and pushes us to reconsider our assumptions in real life. By presenting these characters in all the many different situations they find themselves in, the common theme emerges: those who seek solace in nearness to God (whatever religion they practice) find peace and an ability to move forward into their future, while those who wallow in their pain and anger find themselves lost and empty.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
One never gets the feeling while reading this book, however, that Hegazi is trying to push Islam onto the reader, nor that any of the Muslim characters are pushing Islam onto the others. She presents the deep, spiritual truths of Islam in easy-to-swallow ways that make the reader feel curious about the connection to God we see in the lives of the characters who are content with the life they&#8217;ve been dealt.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
I recommend this read to any and all people who seek a deeper connection to Allah through all the problems and practical issues life presents us with, as well as anyone who is going through the stress of divorce and separation and seeks reprieve. I look forward to Hegazi&#8217;s later works with excitement and hope,<em> inshaAllah</em>.<br />

<p>&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
(This piece was originally published at <a href="http://muslimmatters.org/2014/10/14/the-role-of-a-step-parent/" target="_blank"><span style="color: #993366">MuslimMatters</span></a>)<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>How do you define yourself?</strong><br />
&nbsp;<br />
A Muslim? A student? A brother or sister? Daughter or son? Mother or father? Typically how we define ourselves is so deeply ingrained in our psyche that we rarely take the time to think about who we are and what defines us. However, if you were to take a few moments to really think about what roles are important to you and where you fit in within these relationships, you&#8217;ll realize just how important they are to you. If we dig a little deeper within ourselves we&#8217;ll also realize that each of these relationships and definitions have key factors.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
For example, if you are an older sibling like myself, you might think of being an older sibling as being protective and caring of your younger brother or sister and your role in that relationship is clearly defined. The same goes for if you are a husband or a wife. Not every marriage is the same but we are aware of what we do within each of these relationships and what our responsibilities are.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>The role of a mother</h3>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
In the Hadith of our Prophet ṣallallāhu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam (peace and blessings of Allāh be upon him) we are taught: “Your Heaven lies under the feet of your mother” (Ahmad, Nasai). We are also taught that we should obey and respect our mothers and take care of them as they age:<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><p>“Thy Lord hath decreed that ye worship none but Him, and that ye be kind to parents. Whether one or both of them attain old age in thy life, say not to them a word of contempt, nor repel them, but address them in terms of honor. And out of kindness, lower to them the wing of humility, and say: &#8216;My Lord! bestow on them Thy Mercy even as they cherished me in childhood&#8217;” (17:23-24).</p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are a mother, then you know how much you would give up just to see your child grow to be happy and healthy and to be a loyal servant of Allah subḥānahu wa ta&#8217;āla (glorified and exalted be He). If you are not a mother, you can surely think of something your mother did to help you, regardless of how close you are to her or the type of relationship you have with her. This mother-child relationship is clearly defined both in our own minds and in the beauty of the Qur&#8217;an.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>The role of a step-parent</h3>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
However, what about step-parents? How can one define this role? After much thought and internal struggle the only way I can define my personal role as a step-parent is: CHALLENGING. Now this isn&#8217;t to say that being a biological parent is easy by any means, but the challenges are different. As a step-parent the hardest thing to accept is that, <strong>no matter how much you love your spouse&#8217;s child, they aren&#8217;t your own and therefore the rules are different for you whether you like it or not.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First let me take the most “ideal” situation for step-parents: you&#8217;ve married your spouse who has an infant child from a previous marriage and his or her ex-spouse is 100% out of the picture and your spouse views you as his or her child&#8217;s mother. The child grows up viewing you as his or her rightful mother with all powers and responsibilities bestowed upon you as a mother and everyone lives happily ever after. This situation almost never happens.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>Here&#8217;s what really happens: you fall in love with your spouse for the sake of Allah subḥānahu wa ta&#8217;āla (glorified and exalted be He) and you convince yourself that it can&#8217;t be that hard to take care of his or her child</strong> since at some point in life you want children of your own, (and you&#8217;ve taken care of your brothers, sisters, nieces, nephews, cousins, etc.) so how hard can it be? Oh and that ex-spouse? Well he or she will move on and we&#8217;ll all be friends and everything will be wonderful. Then, you and your spouse get married and you&#8217;ve spent lots of time with the child or children and insha&#8217;Allah they have accepted you into their family either because they are too young to understand what&#8217;s happening or you&#8217;ve spent painstaking hours explaining to them that you could never replace their mother/father, even though very deep down within yourself, that&#8217;s exactly what you want to do but you refuse to admit that to yourself.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Typically, at least within the western world, the child lives primarily with one parent while the other has visitation every other week or so. That means, that as a step-parent, one week it&#8217;s just you and your spouse living as a couple, and then the next week you&#8217;re a mother or father… kind of. And then the next week you&#8217;re not. And so on for the next 18 years of your life.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>The different relationships that a step-parent is faced with</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Now while mothers have that one relationship with their child, a stepmother or stepfather has three relationships to worry about:</strong> their relationship with the child, their relationship with their spouse regarding the child, and their relationship with their spouse&#8217;s ex-husband or ex-wife.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Relationship with the child</h4>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
I&#8217;ll start with the relationship with the child, which for me was the easiest. My husband&#8217;s child was only 1 year old when we got married (he&#8217;s almost 3 now alhamdulilah). This relationship was the easiest because I learned to love him quite quickly and he was too young to really understand why suddenly he has “2 mommies.” <strong>The key word here is I <em>“LEARNED”</em> to love him.</strong> As much as I wish I could say “and then I looked in his eyes and that unconditional love took over me,” I can&#8217;t. I did not create this baby with my husband, I did not carry him for 9 months, I did not give birth to him, and I had not been around to see his first year of life. <strong>Furthermore, as much as I hated myself for thinking it, I really did not like having him around at first because he was a constant reminder that my husband had wanted to have him with someone else. </strong><br />
&nbsp;<br />
These feelings continued for quite some time until the child began calling for me. Suddenly I was the only one who could put him to bed, make his food, or give him a bath. He didn&#8217;t want his daddy to do it, he wanted me… his stepmother to do it. That&#8217;s when I fell in love. When he needed me like a mother, I felt like a mother and suddenly things weren&#8217;t as difficult. I knew my role with him and I could define it to myself and I stopped introducing him to people as “my husband&#8217;s son” and started introducing him as “my stepson.”<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Relationship with your spouse</h4>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
The second relationship you have as a step-parent is the one you have with your spouse regarding the child. This is very different to the relationship you have with your spouse as a husband or a wife. The hardest aspect of this relationship is trying to figure out how your spouse wants you to act toward their child. Alhamdulillah my husband was more than willing to step aside and let me handle bed time, meal time, and bath time, and let me take the child out by myself, or stay alone in the house with him. In time he even let me discipline his son when he was having a tantrum, as most 2 year olds do. However, this is not the case for many step-mommies or step-daddies.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>A type of power struggle typically evolves as a result of this complicated relationship. Some parents don&#8217;t want their spouse to discipline their child or take over certain roles because they feel they are being pushed out. A normal human response to losing control is to fight back and try to take control of everything. It is not unusual for spouses to fight over their roles in the child&#8217;s life and for the biological mother or father to tell the step-parent that it&#8217;s “not their job to do that” when it comes to a responsibility they feel is rightfully theirs as the biological parent.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this situation typically the step-parent will withdraw completely and want nothing to do with the child because they don&#8217;t want to upset their spouse. In addition, <strong>it&#8217;s mentally exhausting and emotionally draining to check yourself at every step and have to wonder “is this my responsibility or my husband&#8217;s/wife&#8217;s?”</strong> There is no outlined way in any psychology book or therapy manual to tell you how to resolve this issue. It normally takes an inordinate amount of patience from both sides and strong communication skills in order to overcome this challenge.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Relationship with spouse&#8217;s ex</h4>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
The third and final relationship you have as a step-parent is your relationship with your spouse&#8217;s ex-husband or ex-wife. <strong>This can either be the most frustrating, enraging, and downright painful relationship you&#8217;ll ever have, or it&#8217;ll be the easiest. </strong>If, on the rare occasion, the divorce was amicable and both parties accepted that the relationship between them did not work and have both moved on and accepted that each will most likely remarry and their child will have two mothers and two fathers, then this relationship for the step-parents is relatively simple. However, more likely than not, the divorce was not pleasant for either party and some hostile feelings remain.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since both parties are normally told by family and friends to ignore each other and just move on with their lives, those hostile feelings need to come down on someone. So why not the person that your ex-spouse marries and is trying to “move in on your child?” It&#8217;s easy to understand the logic behind it: they&#8217;re resentful of the fact that they will always be tied to the one person they don&#8217;t want to remember, they&#8217;re angry that their ex has moved on which makes them feel replaced, they don&#8217;t have the typical nuclear family and often get uncomfortable or even rude comments from others in the community, and their child is calling someone else mama or dada.<strong> I can&#8217;t say that I would feel or act any differently if the roles were reversed.</strong><br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, that justification gives little solace to step-parents. <strong>Typically in our lives if there is someone we don&#8217;t particularly care for, we can keep him or her at a distance and limit communication with them. This doesn&#8217;t work in this scenario.</strong> The person that is taking their frustrations out on you is the mother or father of your stepchild for whom you care very deeply. In turn, you have to accept that the child loves this individual and you cannot let your own personal feelings for their mom or dad show in front of them. <strong>Furthermore, this ex-spouse is a constant, never-ending reminder that the man or woman you married and love did not choose you first. You are second. You might be the “right one” but you will never be the “first one.”</strong> You&#8217;ll never be his or her first spouse or first mother or father of their child. Never. And their ex-spouse will <em>always</em> be there, either through that 6am angry text message or at pick-ups and drop-offs or when your spouse has to make that direct deposit into their ex&#8217;s bank account for child support. They will never go away and <em>you just have to accept it.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Other challenges</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Besides these three relationships you&#8217;ll have as a step-parent, there&#8217;s a whole host of other challenges. What do your parents say about you marrying someone who already has children? What does the community think? How do you comfort your spouse when they have to drop-off their child every other week to their ex-wife or ex-husband and they don&#8217;t realize that it hurts you just as much? <em>What do you say when someone asks you if you have children?</em> What do you do when you disagree with something that the child&#8217;s parents have decided to do? How do you reconcile having <em>absolutely no legal authority</em> over a child that you consider to be your own? How do you define being a step-parent?<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>The hardest part for me about being a step-parent is that no matter how much I love my stepson, no matter how supportive my husband is, and no matter how well I control my feelings towards his ex-wife, <strong>I will always have to put “step” before “parent” and that will never get any easier.</strong> I make du&#8217;a for all the step-parents out there that Allah subḥānahu wa ta&#8217;āla (glorified and exalted be He) makes it easier for you and that you achieve Jannah for everything you go through and everything you sacrifice as a step-parent. May Allah subḥānahu wa ta&#8217;āla (glorified and exalted be He) bless all the stepmoms and stepdads out there who work twice as hard for half the credit. Take solace in pleasing Allah subḥānahu wa ta&#8217;āla (glorified and exalted be He) and turn to Him when it get&#8217;s too hard.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>If Allah helps you, none can overcome you; and if He forsakes you, who is there after Him that can help you? And in Allah (Alone) let believers put their trust. (Qur&#8217;an, Surah Aal-e-Imran, 3:160)<br />
